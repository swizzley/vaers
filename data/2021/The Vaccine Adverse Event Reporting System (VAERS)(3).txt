Patient subsequently went to the ER 2/6/2021 and tested positive for COVID-19 on 2/7/21 (collection date).   See following discharge summary from ED:  82 y.o. female who initially presented to the ED with complaint of generalized weakness, fatigue, fever, and loss of appetite x at least 4 days since receiving Covid 19 vaccine. Her workup in the emergency room was significant for hypoxia with 02 saturation 88% on 2LPM (home nocturnal 02 requirement) with improvement to mid-90s on 4LPM. Blood sugar was 47, Cr 1.61. CXR showed extensive R lung and moderate left lung opacities. She was started on empiric ceftriaxone and azithromycin and admitted to the hospitalist service for further workup and mgmt.   During her stay in the hospital, pt did test positive for Covid 19. She developed rapidly progressive respiratory failure, felt to be secondary to ARDS. There was also question of contributing pulmonary edema, however this was refractory to lasix and thus ARDS was felt to be the most significant factor. She had requested DNR/DNI status, thus as her 02 requirement escalated she was transitioned to 15LPM NRB and then to BiPAP support. Unfortunately, she continued to suffer greatly with the BiPAP in place, and therefore made the decision to transition herself to comfort measures only after visitation from her family.   Her other medical issues were supported as appropriate during her stay, with dextrose infusion for hypoglycemia and AKI, also hyponatremia felt to be due to IVVF.   Unfortunately, am unable to find any documentation regarding how pt was feeling when she received the vaccine compared to her baseline state of health. thus am unable to say whether the severity of her illness represents vaccine enhanced disease or the much more common cytokine release syndrome leading to ARDS. Regardless, she developed ARDS as result of her Covid 19 illness.    Time of death: 1408 on 2/9/21. Cause of death: ARDS due to Covid 19 pneumonia."

This was the first time she had expressed this symptom to me as being something she was concerned about and difficult for her to manage (we have spoken almost daily for many years). Within 24 hours of the second dose of the mRNA vaccine, they called an ambulance to get her and she was taken to the hospital and diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia.   The doctors said it was unrelated, but I found a study with a different vaccine (LAIV) that also seemed to increase the incidence of bacterial pneumonia. They hypothesized through diverting the immune system. So while I don't think the vaccine gave her the bacteria, I do think it may have caused her immune system to be temporarily compromised allowing the bacteria to grow out of control. I feel this is important to report to look for these types of patterns as perhaps it can help others avoid the death spiral that happened to my mother. There were also intervening events between her hospitalization and her death including two successful surgeries (one for a broken hip and another to put in stents in her leg). So to summarize, the first vaccine was within about 2 weeks of the onset of her breathing problems. Within 24 hours of the second vaccine she was hospitalized and diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia. As she was battling bacterial pneumonia in the hospital she broke her hip and was found to have reduced peripheral circulation and had 2 surgeries to correct those. They were successful according to the surgeons, however she died within a week or so of the surgeries.  She had other comorbidities as well which I'm sure predisposed her such as diabetes, hypertension and cancer for many years."

Here at the hospital he was treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam and levofloxacin along with IV fluids and norepinephrine. Despite this he had several fevers with Tmax 103.5F the night of 2/18-2/19 and he required norepinephrine plus vasopressin overnight to maintain blood pressure. Piperacillin/Tazobactam was discontinued in favor of meropenem. His last fever was at 6am on 2/19. ID consult was obtained 2/19/21 and vancomycin and levofloxacin were weaned off. Ultimately his blood pressure improved and he was weaned off of all vasopressors the morning of 2/20. Notably, he never developed severe hypoxemia at rest while in the ICU, but did require BiPAP non-invasive ventilation at night instead of his usual CPAP to keep his oxygen levels > 90% while sleeping and additionally had desaturations into the low 80% range with exertion from which he was slow to recover. His oxygen saturation was >90% on 30-40% FiO2 via aerosol mask overnight and 3L (his current baseline) NC during the day. He was transferred out of the ICU on 2/21 based on hemodynamic improvement, stable oxygenation, and improved mentation and symptoms. Unfortunately, on the morning of 2/22/21, patient had an abrupt change in status and was found to be unresponsive with hypercarbic respiratory failure and hypotension. ABG during this event was 7.16/121/65. BiPAP was initiated as patient's code status was DNR/DNI. CXR with no significant change from 2/18/21. CT of head without contrast was negative for acute processes. Based on lack of rapid improvement, the decision was made by wife to transition to comfort care. Patient died at 1446 on 2/22/21. **Of note: patient was admitted for 1 week for covid 19 pneumonia November 2020. During this hospitalization he was found to have chronic R sided PE, no acute PE."

We agreed on the clinical findings and implemented our plan together.  Please see PA's note for details.  All relevant procedures supervised. Patient arrived to the emergency department due to respiratory symptoms, hypoxic, reported that Wednesday he received his 2nd dose of COVID vaccine.  His initial workup was concern for NSTEMI with elevated troponin and peaked T-waves,  his chest x-ray concerning for COVID/pneumonia.  Patient initially tolerated oxygen by nasal cannula and sepsis protocol was started including IV fluid resuscitation that was done cautiously due to the concern of COVID with respiratory failure.  The biotics were given.  PA-C readdressed code status with patient who confirmed that his DNR DNI, she so contacted his daughter.   Patient had multiorgan failure including acute kidney injury, and pneumonia with respiratory failure +/- respiratory failure.  Due to the concern of NSTEMI patient was initially going to be transfer to was hospital and transfer was started.  Patient respiratory status started deteriorating and his blood pressure dropped slightly but improved after 500 cubic centimeters of IV fluid and he was also placed on a NIPPV. Around 6:00 p.m. patient has significantly desaturation and he discontinued himself NIPPV.   Due to inability to intubate patient, he was ventilated with BVM, patient is slowly improved saturation levels and was opening his eyes, he was placed on a non-rebreather.  At this point there is high concern of ARDS and due to inability to intubate or give for the respiratory support His daughter was at bedside and updated of current medical status and poor prognosis.  Patient continued deteriorating and at this point he had agonal breathing.   His daughter was at bedside and she was made aware of the futile prognosis of patient due to his respiratory failure.   Patient rapidly became bradycardic and went into cardiac arrest.   No CPR was done due to the DNI DNR status of the patient.    Critical Care Procedure Note Authorized and Performed by: MD  Total critical care time: Approximately 30 minutes Due to a high probability of clinically significant, life threatening deterioration, the patient required my highest level of preparedness to intervene emergently and I personally spent this critical care time directly and personally managing the patient. This critical care time included obtaining a history; examining the patient; pulse oximetry; ordering and review of studies; arranging urgent treatment with development of a management plan; evaluation of patient's response to treatment; frequent reassessment; and, discussions with other providers. This critical care time was performed to assess and manage the high probability of imminent, life-threatening deterioration that could result in multi-organ failure. It was exclusive of separately billable procedures and treating other patients and teaching time. Please see MDM section and the rest of the note for further information on patient assessment and treatment.

The patient's medical history included lung disease which required oxygen support. Per patient's wife, no concomitant products were in use within two weeks of the event. The patient's wife also stated he does not take any daily medications.  On 21 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 ( Batch number 029L20A) by injection into his left arm for prophylaxis of Covid-19 infection.  After receiving the vaccine, the patient's wife stated he did not feel well. He experienced extreme weakness. He was not able to stand up or walk for the first few days after getting the shot. ""He could not walk even 3 steps and get in the car"".   On 09 Feb 2021, the patient felt a little bit better and could walk from one bedroom to another. No Medications were used to treat the patient's symptoms. No relevant medical tests were provided.  The patient had an appointment with his healthcare provider (date and time not provided) and was told he could not get the second dose of vaccine unless he got better.    The patient's wife stated she is not blaming the vaccine because her husband had a lung disease prior to getting the vaccine.  His doctor said, (per his wife) this lung disease had weakened him to the point he could not drive his car anymore. His brain was fine before the vaccine.  On 03 Mar 2021, the patient's wife called to say that the patient had finally passed away on 13 Feb 2021.   The second dose of mRNA-1273 was withheld in response to the events while waiting for the patient's condition to improve however; it was never given due to the patient's death.  The events of did not feel well, extreme weakness, unable to walk, and unable to stand were not resolved (presumably) prior to the patient's death. The patient died on 13 Feb 2021.

Per Emergency MD note: ""This is a 72-year-old male with what sounds like diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension who presents via EMS in cardiac arrest.  It sounds like he received his Covid vaccine last week.  Initially he had some mild effects from it.  However over the last day or so he has felt very unwell.  He apparently called his wife today and told her that he was not feeling well and so she returned home.  Shortly thereafter he attempted to get up from his chair.  He then collapsed and fell forward onto his face.  Sounds like his wife had some difficulty rolling him over to perform CPR.  When EMS arrived they found him in PEA.  He received a total of 5 rounds of epinephrine.  At some point they did have return of spontaneous circulation.  However just prior to arriving in the emergency department they lost pulses again.  The patient was intubated with an 8 oh endotracheal tube prior to arrival.""""	"No lab data for this event."	"n/a"	"No prior vaccinations for this event."

Received her second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine at approximately 14:00 and was reported to have expired at home at 20:55. Dr. (Medical Director) spoke with patient's son/caregiver 2/4/21. Son reports that patient was in her usual health yesterday morning, deemed well enough by son to travel for vaccination. He reports she had no bothersome symptoms after either first or second vaccinations. Specifically denied rash, wheeze, and difficulty breathing. Son was with patient throughout the day. In the evening, when preparing for bed, he noted she became suddenly unresponsive in a similar fashion as she has done several times in past years. While in all previous such episodes she recovered within minutes, last evening she did not regain consciousness, experiences a brief period of labored breathing, and died.

He is placed on a lidocaine drip and a right femoral central line was placed by myself.  At this time, norepinephrine drip was initiated given his continued hypotension.  Post intubation chest x-ray suggests possible abdominal pathology and once the patient was stabilized further, he was sent to the CT scanner where CT head without IV contrast and CT chest, abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast was obtained.  He did lose pulses once in the radiology suite.  This was brief.  IV fluids were initiated and he received over 2 L of crystalloid therapy.  He continued to be hypotensive in the emergency department and vasopressin was added.  He also had a single dose of Neo-Synephrine and IV push fashion to help bring his blood pressure up.  CT scan reveals probable bilateral aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis and dilated loops of small bowel without a transition point and pneumatosis involving loops in the left upper quadrant.  I did try to initiate consult with critical care and possible transfer, however he continued to be unstable and coded requiring CPR multiple times.

The patient was diagnosed with kidney disease in 2005, but it was about 1 to 1-1/2 years ago that his kidney disease progressed to Stage 4 Kidney Disease. She said the Veterans Administration diagnosed her husband with his kidney disease, but her husband saw a private doctor, as well as, a VA doctor for his care. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EL3248; Expiration Date: Apr2021) at the age of 74- year-old Intramuscularly at approximately 08:45AM on 15Jan2021 in right arm for COVID-19 immunisation and had no reaction.

The patient had symptoms start earlier in the day of Tuesday, 09Feb2021, after his second COVID-19 Vaccine shot (04Feb2021). The reporter said she and her husband didn't think anything of his symptoms at first. The patient had a temperature of 99.4 degrees on 09Feb2021. She didn't check her husband's temperature again after that time because the nurse at her husband's doctor's office said her husband's temperature was not at an area of concern. The patient was sweaty, off and on, starting 09Feb2021. She clarified he would be sweaty and the cold, but nothing extreme. The patient developed muscle aches, body aches, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting on 09Feb2021. She clarified her husband had fatigue, tiredness, and had trouble with a raspy throat. His raspy throat started Tuesday evening (09Feb2021). His raspy throat felt like he had mucus stuck in his throat, and he was unable to clear the mucus from his throat. The reporter called her husband's primary care doctor on the morning of 10Feb2021 because her husband was having trouble with a raspy throat, and difficulty breathing. She said on Tuesday night (09Feb2021) her husband had to sleep sitting up because he couldn't lay down with his breathing.  He was able to eat breakfast (clarified as oatmeal and an orange), lunch (clarified as soup and a salad), and dinner (clarified as soup and half a sandwich. She said her husband ate all the meat and half of the bread on the sandwich) on 10Feb2021. Her husband's primary care doctor wasn't available to speak to on Wednesday morning (10Feb2021), but the doctor's nurse said it sounded like her husband was having a reaction to his second COVID-19 Vaccine shot. The reporter said her husband's doctor instructed her later in the day to take her husband to the Emergency Room or Urgent Care if he didn't feel any better. Her husband's throat raspiness got worse in the evening of 10Feb2021. His breathing also became worse after dinner in the evening of 10Feb2021. The patient leaned forward over a couple pillows while sitting on their couch as it was easier for him to breath by doing that. They decided at 11:00PM that her husband should go to the Emergency Room. She said her husband was getting very weak, so she and her husband debated if she should call # for an ambulance, or if she should drive him to the Emergency Room. She said her husband was able to dress himself, but with some difficulty, and she assisted walking him from their house to their car. She said she had turned to walk away from her husband while he was at the side of their car, and then she heard her husband make a noise. He had appeared to have passed out. She clarified in the past, her husband had passed out prior to his pacemaker. She said she dialed #, and the # operator told her how to tell if her husband was still breathing. She said she couldn't tell if her husband was still breathing. She said when the ambulance arrived at her house, the ambulance staff worked on her husband for a long time. The reporter thought her husband had died at the time he had collapsed at the side of their car. The patient took a sugar free cough syrup Tuesday night (09Feb2021), and then again a couple times on Wednesday (10Feb2021) as treatment. The patient had thrown up a couple times, but found that the sugar free cough syrup soothed his cough the night before (09Feb2021). She said her husband had taken 2 TUMS early on Wednesday morning at approximately 2:00AM (10Feb2021). He had said his stomach was bothering him on 10Feb2021. He said he thought he may be constipated, so he took 1 Senokot (Clarified as GeriCare Senna-Plus Natural Vegetable Laxative with Stool Softener) on 10Feb2021. She clarified her husband had diarrhea on 09Feb2021, but felt on 10Feb2021 he may have been constipated. There were no adverse events required a visit to Emergency Room since Patient's wife stated she was getting her husband to their car, so she could drive him to the Emergency Room, when her husband collapsed and died or to Physician Office as they spoke with the nurse at her husband's primary care doctor's office.

Upon arrival to triage she was obviously dyspneic with significantly low oxygen saturations. O2 sats on arrival were 65%, improved to mid 90's with O2 6 liters per NC. Admitting diagnosis: hypoxic respiratory failure post COVID vaccine. Lab work shows an elevation of the BUN and creatinine at 31 and 1.71 which is slightly higher than her usual baseline levels. BNP is elevated at 2 448 with a mildly elevated troponin. Procalcitonin is also elevated. Patient's white blood cell count is 11/07. Full viral panel including COVID-19 is not detected. All blood cultures and respiratory cultures were negative. Patient chest x-ray shows numerous bilateral patchy opacities which is significantly different from her previous chest x-ray here. Empiric rejection treatment initiated including high dose methylprednisolone, plasmapheresis, IVIG, Thymoglobulin. She continued to decline and ultimately required intubation, proning and paralyzing on 2/8/2021 and the VV ECMO cannulation on 2/13/2021. EGD done 2/14/2021 as unable to pass the TEE probe during cannulation prior day (unable to complete due to abnormal anatomy). Acute pupil exam change in the early am hours of 2/15/2021 prompted urgent head CT which revealed catastrophic brain bleed. Brainstem reflexes were lost soon after. Despite placing an EVD emergently at bedside, brain stem reflexes were not recovered. GOL engaged and patient not an organ donation candidate. Therefore discussion with sister at bedside resulted in decision for cessation of life support. Patient expired shortly after support withdrawn and pronounced dead on 2/15/2021 at 11:11 AM.,"

History is limited due to the patient's current clinical condition and so is primarily obtained from EMS.  EMS reports that he tested positive for COVID-19 5 days ago.  He began developing shortness of breath yesterday and his family called because his lips and fingers were blue today and he appeared short of breath.  On EMS arrival he had a room air saturation of less than 50% so he was placed on nonrebreather with improvement in his saturation to 70% and he was transported to the emergency department.  Patient does admit to shortness of breath.  He denies any chest pain.  He is noted to have a cast on his left ankle and said that he broke his left ankle on 23 December but has not had surgery.  He denies any new pain or swelling of the leg.  In the ED he was placed on 15L nasal cannula and NRB mask with improvement in SPO2 to low 90s. Additional work up revealed troponin of 1.35, lactic acid 5.8, and d-dimer 14.4.  He received dexamethasone and was placed on heparin gtt.   1/31 admitted to ICU Acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 vs heart failure vs PE.  CXR with bilateral hazy infiltrates more pronounced in the bases and left periphery and suspected multifocal pneumonia.   At risk for PE given LLE immobility in the setting of COVID-19 with significantly elevated d-dimer. RISK of CTA outweighs benefit given AKI and iodine allergy. Continue with empiric treatment with heparin gtt.   Admitted to ICU with SO2 in 60s-70s on 15L and NRB. Attempted 50L 95% FIO2 high flow and nasal cannula. Given lasix 40mg IV with good diuresis however SPO2 still remained low 80s with RR 40s and PO2 42 so the decision was made to intubate.  Oxygenation improved following intubation, with further improvement following recruitment maneuver and increase in PEEP. FIO2 weaned to 90% with SPO2 remaining in mid 90s. Will continue to wean FIO2 as able.  ARDS net protocol as much as possible. Consider prone ventilation and/or epoprostenol if unable to improve .  VAP Bundle: HOB >30 degrees; Oral care per nursing standard and on DVT/PPI prophylaxis Sedation: Target Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS) of 0 to -2 with propofol and fentanyl. Check baseline TG levels.

He was diagnosed with COVID 19 5 days prior to admission, and had worsening respiratory status.  He was intubated after arrival, and was on ventilator for the entire intervening time, until he was extubated on 2/20 at the time of transition to Comfort measures only.    Prior to developing COVID 19, he had received his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, as a member of the school system.  He had a fractured L ankle after a fall on 12/31/20, and had a cast in place at the time of admission.  He received Tocilizumab on 1/31, and underwent several cycles of prone positioning, beginning on 2/2.  He completed a course of Decadron, he received  Ceftriaxone and azithromycin beginning on admission, and completed a course of these.  Anticoagulation with enoxaparin was utilized due to coagulopathy associated with COVID 19.  Vasopressor support was required at times, as well as diuresis for fluid management.    He required high levels of sedation to maintain ventilator synchrony, and high levels of ventilator support with high oxygen levels throughout his stay.  Tracheostomy was being considered, but family decided that since he was not going to have good recovery, withdrawal of support, and allowing death was the appropriate choice for the patient and for them.   He was extubated at 2100 on 2/20/2021.   Death was pronounced at 2123 on 2/20/2021.  Children were at bedside."

Clinical course was the follows the next day on 01Feb2021 at 9:30AM the patient was dressed and ready to go to dialysis. His oxygen dropped too low to 76. He wanted an ambulance called. He went into the hospital. The patient was confused, and he was not normally confused. In the hospital the physicians said he had pneumonia, but it wasn't that bad. The doctors were baffled. He also was in the hospital for something with toxins. He had a lung problem for a long time. If he didn't go to the bathroom the toxins were hitting the liver and then the toxins were going to the brain. When he was in the hospital he couldn't eat or swallow. The first day he did eat a bit, but he had dialysis in the hospital, and it knocks him out. They were giving him antibiotics IV. He couldn't swallow any of his pills. He was in there for 11 days and had not eaten. He couldn't swallow any pills. He started going to sleep and they started giving him Morphine drip at the end.

After developing an adverse reaction that started with nausea and then got progressively worse, including vomiting blood, Mom was rushed to the emergency room where she was tested for Covid-19 due to hospital policy (neg. result) and admitted to the intensive care unit.  Mother died on Sunday, February 21, 2021.    NOTE:  Mother was doing well with her heart and renal conditions until she received the second dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine on February 18, 2021, directly or indirectly causing her death three days later on February 21, 2021.  It is unfortunate that we are all advised (sometimes ill advised), particularly those with underlying conditions, to get vaccinated without the benefits of knowing when the vaccine can cause more harm than good.  For obvious reasons, the approval of covid vaccines was rushed and thus the Pfizer and Moderna Studies are not thorough and lack in data to support an all call for everyone to get vaccinated in the name of herd immunity.  Without the appropriate data, My Mother is DEAD!  Sadly, there are probably more unreported deaths caused by the vaccine.  While you have immunity from liability, you still have a moral obligation to collect data and advise accordingly.    My goal is to save lives by sharing my mother?s personal experience and death after receiving the vaccine with everyone I know through every available resource.  It is unconscionable that I have to shoulder the burden of getting the facts out about your vaccine so that individuals with underlying conditions can make a proper, informed decision about getting vaccinated.  Sadly, I receive over 100 questions a day via social media from individuals inquiring about whether or not they or their loved ones should opt for the vaccine.  I am not a medical professional?this is your job!  Until you assume responsibility, I will continue advising anyone with heart and/or renal conditions to stay away from any and all covid vaccinations.  Instead of the massive all call for vaccinations, we need further information and data from additional studies that will give more insight as to when the vaccine can cause more harm than good, as in My Mother?s case."

Assisted living facility staff called. He mentioned that the facility staff had earlier noticed that she was dragging her right foot and and has been needing more assistance with activities. The patient was walking and did not feel well. She was lowered to the ground and had a witnessed cardiac arrest. The ambulance was called and she was reportedly found to have pulseless electrical activity. She was given Epinephrine and Amiodarone with return of pulse. The patient was brought to the Emergency Room and was evaluated by ER physician. EKG showed atrial fibrillation, ventricular rate = 66, RBBB with Brugada pattern. She was emergently brought to the Cath Lab. Cardiac catheterization showed normal coronary arteries but EF 35-40%. Repeat EKG showed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response = 110, RBBB. Therapeutic hypothermia was initiated. The patient was admitted to the ICU on mechanical ventilation with TV 350 RR 14 PEEP 5. She is sedated with Propofol and Fentanyl IV. She is on Levophed IV. ABG showed pH = 7.22, pCO2 = 53, pO2 = 66, O2 sat = 88%. Lactate level = 9.5. WBC 8.8, Hgb 13.4, Hct 46, Platelets 138. Na 138, K 3.2, Cl 102, bicarb 20, BUN 16, Crea 1.19, estimated GFR = 44 mL/minute. Magnesium 2.7. Glucose levels have ranged from 273-312. Pro-Calcitonin = 0.26. Albumin 3.7. SGOT 262, SGPT 294. Troponin elevated at 47. Pro-BNP = 600. Urinalysis showed large blood. Chest x-ray showed vague peripheral pneumonitis. Endotracheal tube is in place. COVID-19 test by PCR is negative (2/5/21).    COURSE IN HOSPITAL  The patient was admitted to the ICU and was followed by Pulmonary/Critical Care.  Patient was maintained on mechanical ventilation, sedated with propofol and fentanyl IV.  Vasopressors were administered (Levophed IV).  She was managed with therapeutic hypothermia.  She was followed by Cardiology.  Foley catheter was inserted for close input/output monitoring.  Neuro checks, vital signs, daily weights, pulse oximetry, cardiac telemetry and fingersticks were monitored.  She was given sodium bicarbonate IV due to metabolic acidosis.  She was also given insulin IV drip.  Potassium chloride IV was administered due to hypokalemia.  The patient was given amiodarone IV.  Platelet count was noted to be low but stable.  Glucose levels were within acceptable range.  Metabolic acidosis resolved.  Hypokalemia resolved.  Hypomagnesemia resolved.  There were elevated LFTs which improved.  Elevated CPK also improved.  She was taken off hypothermia protocol.  Sedation was decreased and she was able to open her eyes with verbal stimulus but unable to follow commands.  Ammonia level was normal.  Neurology evaluated the patient.  EEG showed left periodic epileptiform discharges consistent with severe diffuse encephalopathy.  Chest x-ray revealed right upper lung and left mid lung increasing opacity for which meropenem IV was started.  Levophed was discontinued.  Initially she had peripheral cyanosis, but this resolved upon discontinuation of vasopressors.  Brain MRI was done demonstrating diffuse bilateral small and moderate-sized ischemic foci throughout the cerebellum and cerebellar region suggestive of embolism.  There also was chronic marked atrophy and moderate small-vessel gliosis.  CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING DEMISE  Based on neurologic evaluation, her prognosis for meaningful neurologic recovery was thought to be extremely poor.  The patient was evaluated and followed by Palliative Care. She does not have family members and had designated her neighbor friends as her power of attorney.

Assisted living facility staff called. He mentioned that the facility staff had earlier noticed that she was dragging her right foot and and has been needing more assistance with activities. The patient was walking and did not feel well. She was lowered to the ground and had a witnessed cardiac arrest. The ambulance was called and she was reportedly found to have pulseless electrical activity. She was given Epinephrine and Amiodarone with return of pulse. The patient was brought to the Emergency Room and was evaluated by ER physician. EKG showed atrial fibrillation, ventricular rate = 66, RBBB with Brugada pattern. She was emergently brought to the Cath Lab. Cardiac catheterization showed normal coronary arteries but EF 35-40%. Repeat EKG showed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response = 110, RBBB. Therapeutic hypothermia was initiated. The patient was admitted to the ICU on mechanical ventilation with TV 350 RR 14 PEEP 5. She is sedated with Propofol and Fentanyl IV. She is on Levophed IV. ABG showed pH = 7.22, pCO2 = 53, pO2 = 66, O2 sat = 88%. Lactate level = 9.5. WBC 8.8, Hgb 13.4, Hct 46, Platelets 138. Na 138, K 3.2, Cl 102, bicarb 20, BUN 16, Crea 1.19, estimated GFR = 44 mL/minute. Magnesium 2.7. Glucose levels have ranged from 273-312. Pro-Calcitonin = 0.26. Albumin 3.7. SGOT 262, SGPT 294. Troponin elevated at 47. Pro-BNP = 600. Urinalysis showed large blood. Chest x-ray showed vague peripheral pneumonitis. Endotracheal tube is in place. COVID-19 test by PCR is negative (2/5/21).    COURSE IN HOSPITAL  The patient was admitted to the ICU and was followed by Pulmonary/Critical Care.  Patient was maintained on mechanical ventilation, sedated with propofol and fentanyl IV.  Vasopressors were administered (Levophed IV).  She was managed with therapeutic hypothermia.  She was followed by Cardiology.  Foley catheter was inserted for close input/output monitoring.  Neuro checks, vital signs, daily weights, pulse oximetry, cardiac telemetry and fingersticks were monitored.  She was given sodium bicarbonate IV due to metabolic acidosis.  She was also given insulin IV drip.  Potassium chloride IV was administered due to hypokalemia.  The patient was given amiodarone IV.  Platelet count was noted to be low but stable.  Glucose levels were within acceptable range.  Metabolic acidosis resolved.  Hypokalemia resolved.  Hypomagnesemia resolved.  There were elevated LFTs which improved.  Elevated CPK also improved.  She was taken off hypothermia protocol.  Sedation was decreased and she was able to open her eyes with verbal stimulus but unable to follow commands.  Ammonia level was normal.  Neurology evaluated the patient.  EEG showed left periodic epileptiform discharges consistent with severe diffuse encephalopathy.  Chest x-ray revealed right upper lung and left mid lung increasing opacity for which meropenem IV was started.  Levophed was discontinued.  Initially she had peripheral cyanosis, but this resolved upon discontinuation of vasopressors.  Brain MRI was done demonstrating diffuse bilateral small and moderate-sized ischemic foci throughout the cerebellum and cerebellar region suggestive of embolism.  There also was chronic marked atrophy and moderate small-vessel gliosis.  CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING DEMISE  Based on neurologic evaluation, her prognosis for meaningful neurologic recovery was thought to be extremely poor.  The patient was evaluated and followed by Palliative Care. She does not have family members and had designated her neighbor friends as her power of attorney.

The events were reported as serious as involved hospitalization. The patient passed away on an unspecified date in Feb2021. It was not reported if an autopsy was performed. The clinical course of the events included the following information. On 21Sep2020, a spontaneous report was received from a consumer, via a company representative, regarding a 74-year-old male who was being treated with FIRDAPSE 10 MG (amifampridine). On 22Sep2020, additional information was received from a consumer. On 02Oct2020, additional information was received from a consumer and chemotherapy was added as a co-suspect. On 01Feb2021, additional information was received from a consumer via a company representative. On 09Feb2021, additional information was received from a consumer, and this case was determined to be the master case for cases 2021CAT00039 and 2021CAT00052 (both invalid, duplicate cases) and the information was merged into this case (2020CAT00505). This case was re-assessed as serious/unexpected, and COVID vaccine was added as co-suspect. On 18Feb2021, additional information was received from a consumer via a company representative. On 19Feb2021, additional information was received from a patient ambassador via a company representative. Medical history included LEMS (Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome) and migraines. Concomitant products included: an unknown statin, pantoprazole, and acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN) 81 mg. On 18Sep2020, the patient started treatment with FIRDAPSE 10 mg at 10 mg, 3x/day orally for LEMS. On 19Sep2020 and 20Sep2020, after starting the product, the patient experienced moderate headaches. On 21Sep2020, the patient did not experience a headache. On 22Sep2020, the patient experienced a headache that was ""4/10."" He had taken acetaminophen; aspirin; caffeine (EXCEDRIN) and ibuprofen as treatment and it ""helped."" The patient had not spoken to his HCP (health care provider) about the event but was going to call his HCP and ask to increase his dose of FIRDAPSE. The product was working and he was walking better, but he had heard people taking up to 80 mg a day. As of 22Sep2020, product use was ongoing and headaches were improved. On 02Oct2020, it was learned that his medical history included being prone to headaches (also reported as migraines ever since he was a kid) and ""chemo"" for small cell lung cancer stage 4 which was in his liver and lymph nodes. Concomitant products included furosemide. It was noted that the patient had been on the product for 4 to 5 days when he experienced his moderate headaches. He had the headaches for just a couple days, but he wasn't sure if it was due to the FIRDAPSE or it was the chemo. He took ""a couple"" of ibuprofen and he was ""alright."" On an unspecified date, the patient was in contact with his HCP and he was told to ""keep an eye on it"" (presumed headaches) and see if it got worse. They agreed that it could have been the chemo or a ""fluke"" thing. He also spoke to his HCP about his FIRDAPSE dose of 10 mg, 3x/day not being enough. He would switch and do a couple doses of 15 mg and it was better, but not enough. His HCP thought he should be taking 20 mg 3x/day, so he was working with the patient's insurance and pharmacy to get it changed. As of 02Oct2020, FIRDAPSE and chemo treatment were ongoing and moderate headaches were resolved (reported as he'd been good for a few days). On 01Feb2021 and 09Feb2021, it was learned that on 02Oct2020, the patient's FIRDAPSE dose increased to 20 mg, 3x/day. On an unspecified date, the patient received the COVID vaccine at an unreported dose, route, and frequency of administration for an unreported indication. After the patient received the COVID vaccine, he experienced a bad reaction (unspecified). Since 27Jan2021 (reported as since Wednesday, relative to 01Feb2021), the patient had been sick. On 31Jan2021, the patient went to the emergency room, and they thought he had a blood clot on his lung. Subsequently, he was admitted to the hospital. Initially, when the patient was in the hospital, they took all his medications away, including his FIRDAPSE, as the pharmacy was managing his medication. The patient wife was able to get the doctors to let the patient keep his FIRDAPSE in his room with him before he missed any doses because he could not walk without his FIRDAPSE. On an unspecified date in 2021, the patient had radiation of his head and lung for his cancer (previously reported medical history), and ""they"" (presumed his medical provider) said he could have a raspy voice and headache, which he did experience but then resolved. While in the hospital, the patient's blood pressure was not stable. It went ""up and down, up and down."" He had fluid in the bottom right lobe of his lung, where the cancer was, and they could not ""tap it"" due to the blood pressure issues. They were trying to get the fluid out every other way they could. The doctors said he had inflammation in the bottom of his lung. He was given a ""good dose"" of prednisone, but he was just exhausted. They were trying to control his blood pressure and his pulse. When they got one of them ""up,"" the other went ""down."" The doctors said that the patient's LEMS had nothing to do with why he was in the hospital. His wife expressed her gratitude for the FIRDAPSE and how it had helped him. As of 09Feb2021, treatment with FIRDAPSE was ongoing. The patient was still in the hospital and not doing well, also reported that he was still the same, he had not improved but he had not worsened. The blood clot on his lung, blood pressure fluctuation and pulse issues, fluid in the bottom right lobe of his lung, inflammation in the bottom of his lung, and exhaustion were not resolved. The status of the bad reaction to the COVID vaccine was not reported. No additional information was provided. On 18Feb2021 and 19Feb2021, it was learned that the patient's medical history included: muscle weakness and lung cancer with brain metastases. On unspecified dates, after starting FIRDAPSE, the patient's muscle weakness began severely progressing, and he experienced fatigue. The weakness was worsening significantly, even after being on the medication (presumed FIRDAPSE). On 14Feb2021 or 15Feb2021, the patient was discharged from the hospital. On 18Feb2021, the patient took his last dose of FIRDAPSE. On 18Feb2021 or 19Feb2021 (reported as last night, relative to 19Feb2021; yet also reported as either 18Feb2021 or 19Feb2021), the patient passed away. The cause of death was unknown. A 74-year-old male, with a history of migraines and chemotherapy for metastatic small cell lung cancer, was taking an unknown statin, furosemide, pantoprazole, and Aspirin. He added FIRDAPSE for LEMS on 18Sep2020 and experienced headaches for a couple days, but he wasn't sure if it was due to the FIRDAPSE or chemo. After COVID vaccine, he experienced a bad reaction (unspecified). Since 27Jan2021, he was hospitalized with a blood clot on his lung. He had brain and lung radiation for cancer. While in the hospital, he had fluid and inflammation in the bottom right lobe of his lung, where the cancer was, which count not be drained due to labile blood pressure. His muscle weakness began progressing and he experienced fatigue. In Feb2021, he was discharged on FIRDAPSE. A few days post-discharge, he died.

This the first case out of six cases. Patients grandson reported for the patient (reporters grandfather) that a 97-year-old male (same age during vaccination) patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date of 2021, as single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patients medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Reporter stated that So, he doesnt exactly know. His grandfather was the first phase to get the Pfizer vaccination (Confirmed as Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine) back in March (Further not clarified). He was in a residential home with 5 other elderly residents with him. They all got vaccinated with the first Pfizer shot (Confirmed as Covid 19 vaccine) and they all died within the 5 weeks after their first shot. Honestly the only thing that he can pinpoint with my aunt and other people and loved ones we have talked to come together because only two of the residents were on hospice and the other people were not on hospice. They should not have died they just died. he doesnt know if it was a side effect, he knows if it was a reaction but all of the six residents that got vaccinated died within their first vaccination shot. Within the 5 weeks after the first vaccination. He was not sure other residents got the second vaccination, but his grandfather died 09Feb2021. Reporter stated he only have detail for his grandfather and other residents, and they died in their sleep supposedly. They died in their sleep. Both of them died in their sleep (Further not clarified hence not captured in tab). He just feels, his grandfather was not on hospice he was healthy considering the underlying problem that they had but they were supposed to get vaccinated with the Moderna and the day that we got there they changed the vaccination to Pfizer. So, they had the on-duty nurse there to answer any of the questions that we had. We asked then all the questions we had. We felt ok with it, everybody got vaccinated that day. My grandfather died within a week and a half after his after vaccination. So, he didnt get the second and by the middle of march their resident also died. The only thing I can tie to it is the first dose of Pfizer vaccination. Regarding Height and weight reporter stated he do not know exact. he wont say he was 5 (feet) 8 (inches) when he passed away, he believed either between 115 (pounds) and 120 (pounds) when he passed away.

Footnotes:
"1. Submitting a report to VAERS does not mean that healthcare personnel or the vaccine caused or contributed to the adverse"
"event (possible side effect)."
"---"
Caveats:
"1. <p> VAERS accepts reports of adverse events and reactions that occur following vaccination. Healthcare providers, vaccine"
"manufacturers, and the public can submit reports to VAERS. While very important in monitoring vaccine safety, VAERS reports"
"alone cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness. The reports may contain"
"information that is incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental, or unverifiable. Most reports to VAERS are voluntary, which means they"
"are subject to biases. This creates specific limitations on how the data can be used scientifically. Data from VAERS reports"
"should always be interpreted with these limitations in mind. </p> <p> The strengths of VAERS are that it is national in scope"
"and can quickly provide an early warning of a safety problem with a vaccine. As part of CDC and FDA's multi-system approach to"
"post-licensure vaccine safety monitoring, VAERS is designed to rapidly detect unusual or unexpected patterns of adverse events,"
"also known as ""safety signals."" If a safety signal is found in VAERS, further studies can be done in safety systems such as"
"the CDC's Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) or the Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) project. These systems do not have"
"the same limitations as VAERS, and can better assess health risks and possible connections between adverse events and a vaccine."
"</p> <p> Key considerations and limitations of VAERS data: <ul><li> Vaccine providers are encouraged to report any clinically"
"significant health problem following vaccination to VAERS, whether or not they believe the vaccine was the cause. </li><li>"
"Reports may include incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental and unverified information. </li><li> The number of reports alone"
"cannot be interpreted or used to reach conclusions about the existence, severity, frequency, or rates of problems associated"
"with vaccines. </li><li> VAERS data are limited to vaccine adverse event reports received between 1990 and the most recent date"
"for which data are available. </li><li> VAERS data do not represent all known safety information for a vaccine and should be"
"interpreted in the context of other scientific information. </li></ul> </p>"
"2."
"3. Some items may have more than 1 occurrence in any single event report, such as Symptoms, Vaccine Products, Manufacturers, and"
"Event Categories. If data are grouped by any of these items, then the number in the Events Reported column may exceed the total"
"number of unique events. If percentages are shown, then the associated percentage of total unique event reports will exceed 100%"
"in such cases. For example, the number of Symptoms mentioned is likely to exceed the number of events reported, because many"
