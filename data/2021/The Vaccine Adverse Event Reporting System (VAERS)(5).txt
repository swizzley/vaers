He presented to my office today acutely with a several day history of increasing shortness of breath.  He has increased his prednisone at home recently and been increasing the frequency of his DuoNebs.  Despite this, he states that his oxygen saturations have been staying in the low 80s.  He has a hard time walking due to the shortness of breath.  He states previous to about a week ago he was doing very well.  He denies any fever.  He denies any known exposure to coronavirus (COVID-19).  In the office today his oxygen saturations were 88% on 4 L. Because of his failure of outpatient therapy, he will be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and treatment.  This patient has a history of severe respiratory decompensation that happens very quickly.  Therefore, it is medically urgent we get him into the hospital.     3/25/21 Admission HPI71 y.o. male with a known history of severe COPD and type 2 diabetes mellitus.  He came to my office with a several day history of increasing shortness of breath.  He had increased his oral steroids and breathing treatments at home and despite this was still having oxygen saturations in the low to mid 80s on 2-4 L of supplemental oxygen.  In my office he was extremely diminished and had basically failed outpatient therapy.  Therefore he was admitted to inpatient status for acute treatment of a severe COPD exacerbation requiring IV antibiotics and IV steroids.  He was admitted and treated with IV treatments.  He did recover nicely.  However, he was found to be extremely physically deconditioned.  Because of this he was thought to be an excellent candidate for swing bed and is being transitioned to swing bed.    4/5/21 ER Practitioner Note: Upon arrival to ED trauma room I found patient to be in cardiac arrest, CPR in progress. History is that EMS was called to the scene for a patient with chest pain.  Shortly after arrival at his home  patient developed a cardiac arrest.  They followed standard ACLS  protocol and the patient was intubated. Blood sugar normal. As CPR was given, medications were administered consisting of epinephrine and 1 mg in 2 different doses along with 1 amp of bicarb. IV access via an IO. Patient was then transported to the emergency department.  Upon arrival, CPR was continued and oxygen supplied via endotracheal tube with good tube placement verified by auscultation and good sat readings.  Monitor was placed and patient demonstrated initially a sinus rhythm but there was no pulse.  Therefore, diagnosis was PEA and no reversible causes were identified.  ACLS protocol was followed with epinephrine 1 mg IV every 5 min.  He received a total that including EMS, 5 mg of epinephrine and 1 amp of bicarb.  Monitor at this point revealed the rhythm changed to an agonal rhythm.  When CPR was given, there was good results from the CPR.  However, CPR discontinued and there is no pulse and patient had an agonal  rhythm for several minutes, pupils were fixed but not dilated year.  Lungs demonstrating clear bilateral breath sounds when he was bagged via the endotracheal tube.  No external signs of any trauma noted. The patient's sister is here and she is a registered nurse.  We had discussed management at this point with her and all were in agreement that the code be terminated.  At 1015, patient was pronounced deceased..    ACLS protocol was followed.

Before we could take her to see a doctor, she fell while trying to get out of bed at 7am the next morning. She had trouble getting up and exerted a lot of energy trying on her own. She called for my husband and I to help her get up. I grabbed her around the waist and my husband held her walker for her as support. Upon rising (mostly of her own ability) she was so exhausted that we had her sit on her walker and rest a moment. My husband went to check on her twice over the next 15-20 minutes, but when he returned again she was showing classic stroke signs and EMS was called. They arrived quickly and agreed. She was taken immediately to the ER, where they also agreed that it looked like a stroke. She was admitted as they continued to run tests, but she continued to decline more and more each day at the hospital losing motor skills and ability to speak. She was not able to move her right side at all and the left side was fidgety and had uncontrollably flailing that left her bruises on her arm and leg. She was also excessively sleepy. After loads of testings and images, the MRIs finally showed that the brain stem was extremely inflamed and it was an auto-immune response. By this time, she was already a vegetable in the ICU ward under incubation, IVs and a feeding tube. They continued to run more tests and brought in infectious diseases, but they ultimately said her body was fighting an infection that she did not have. They attempted a hemoglobin treatment with an oncologist to shut down her immune system but never consulted with her renal doctor, even through they were very concerned about renal failure.  She could not complete the treatment and only received 4 out of the 5 doses they wanted to give her because of her kidney counts. They said that the auto-immune attack was very aggressive and they could not shut it down. In the early morning of 4/28/21, they finally contacted her kidney doctor and she was put on dialysis as a last effort to try to save her, but it was too late and all her organs were failing. She passed at 1:56 pm. Patient was homebound during the pandemic and did not leave the house unless she was visiting her doctor's office. My husband and I have limited contact at our jobs, as we work in small offices, and our children (that also lived with her) were being schooled virtually. There is nothing that I know that could have caused her immune system to go into overdrive, except for the vaccine that was administered less than 2 weeks (which is considered the time frame for vaccine immunity) prior to her symptoms."

On 05-APR-2021, the patient had seizure due to hemorrhagic stroke. On an unspecified date, the patient experienced brain compression, brain stem haemorrhage, brain stem syndrome, cerebral haemorrhage, hemiplegia, possible cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, biopsy soft tissue, and brain scan abnormal, and was hospitalized.  On 06-APR-2021, the patient had a surgery to remove pressure on brain and brain stem (craniectomy). The surgeon noted alarmingly low platelet counts (results unspecified). The patient had platelet transfusion. The patient was hospitalized for '4 days'. The patient continued to bleed on 06-APR-2021 and 07-APR-2021. The patient was removed from life support on 08-APR-2021. The patient died on 08-APR-2021. It was unknown if autopsy was performed. Laboratory data reported following: Brain scan was abnormal  and showed abnormal, multi-focal brain bleeds and increased compression of brain. On 07-APR-2021, Brain scan abnormal which showed increased bleeding and brain stem injury. On 08-APR-2021, the patient died from possible cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Laboratory data (dates unspecified) included: Biopsy soft tissue (NR: not provided) unknown, Pathology test (NR: not provided) unknown. On 08-APR-2021, the subject died from possible cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. It was unknown if an autopsy was performed. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient died of possible cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, brain compression, brain stem haemorrhage, brain stem syndrome, cerebral haemorrhage, hemiplegia, seizure, haemorrhagic stroke and continued to bleed on 08-APR-2021, had not recovered from headache, vomiting, and platelet count decreased, and the outcome of biopsy soft tissue and brain scan abnormal was not reported. This report was serious (Death, and Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged). This case, involving the same patient is linked to 20210441454.  Additional information was received on 24-MAY-2021. Following information was added and incorporated into the narrative. Additional events of haemorrhagic stroke and continued to bleed were added, seriousness of events platelet count, vomiting, and headache was updated, additional reference numbers were added, additional vaccination date added in narrative, labeling updated, and course of event and laboratory data updated. It was determined that Manufacturer Case Number 20210441454 was a duplicate of this case. All relevant information regarding this case will be submitted under Manufacturer Case Number 20210500861. Upon review, the following information was amended: events biopsy soft tissue and brain scan abnormal was updated from non-serious to serious as this was on the earlier VAERS report.; Sender's Comments: V2: Additional information received regarding updates in seriousness of events, labeling, course of events, case identifier; and additional evets of hemorrhagic stroke and ""continued to  bleed"" did not alter prior assessment.    This fatal spontaneous report (VAERS ID 1244328) concerned a 59- year- old female who experienced vomiting, headache and seizures and was hospitalized for brain compression, brain stem hemorrhage, brain stem syndrome, cerebral hemorrhage, hemorrhagic stroke, hemiplegia, possible cerebral venous sinus thrombosis 16 days after Janssen COVID-19 vaccine was administered for prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. The patient's height, and weight were not reported. The patient was pre-diabetic with no known allergies. Concomitant medications were not reported. Biopsy soft tissue was done (results not reported) and brain scan showed multi-focal brain bleeds and increased compression of brain; the patient underwent neurosurgery.

Follow-up scan next day showed increased/continued bleeding and brain stem injury and a day later she died from possible cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. It was unknown if an autopsy was performed. Although the  subject's pre-diabetic status may have contributed, based on evolving knowledge of Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS, per definition from Brighton Collaboration - BC) and considering the low platelet count and temporal relationship to vaccination (BC Criteria level 5), the events are assessed to have a plausible relationship with vaccination.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: POSSIBLE CEREBRAL VENOUS SINUS THROMBOSIS""	"Test Date: 202104; Test Name: Platelet count; Result Unstructured Data: alarmingly low platelet count; Test Date: 20210406; Test Name: Brain scan abnormal; Result Unstructured Data: Abnormal, multi-focal brain bleeds and increased compression of brain.; Test Date: 20210407; Test Name: Brain scan abnormal; Result Unstructured Data: increased bleeding and brain stem injury; Test Name: Platelet count; Result Unstructured Data: decreased; Test Name: Biopsy soft tissue; Result Unstructured Data: unknown; Test Name: Pathology test; Result Unstructured Data: unknown"	"Pre-diabetic"	"No prior vaccinations for this event."

On 3/23/21 she started to have new onset of generalized muscles aches and weakness.  She started feeling some pain in her back, which then spread to arms and legs. She is now beginning to feel weakness in her core and extremities. Having difficulty lifting arms above head. She is still able to walk without difficulty but legs do feel weak. Increase in SOB as well. Myalgias and chest pain resolved within a week, however she continued to feel weak, tired, and had DOE. She developed ""brain fog"" and talked to her boss about taking short-term disability as it had been hard to work.  No appetite. On 4/1/21, she presented to the ED with 2 weeks of worsening generalized weakness, SOB, lightheadedness, dizziness and found to have acute anemia. Was admitted for further workup.  Hgb at admission was 5.4.   This admission diagnosed her with a new warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia. This is new since the COVID vaccine was administered.  Upon admission there was no thrombocytopenia, so there was low suspicion for microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, TTP/HUS, or DIC. Peripheral blood smear at that time suggested a leukoerythroblastic blood picture (could be Bone Marrow recovery post chemo) but with marked normocytic, normochromic anemia, and with increased circulating erythroid precursors and increased red blood cell regeneration; spherocytes and fragments are present supporting hemolysis.  DAT positive (both IgG and C3) along with other hemolysis lab including elevated LDH, Bilirubin, haptoglobin 3, and PBS c/w hemolysis; no evidence of MAHA. So warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia is the most likely explanation. She had negative cold agglutinin antibodies <1:32 on 4/9. Started on methylprednisolone on 4/2/21, but Hgb continued to steadily decline despite treatment. Continued on methylprednisolone 87.5mg daily. Rituxan 375mg/m2 was started on 4/6/21 with plans for weekly infusions for a total of 4 weeks.  there was concern for a GI bleed on 4/10-4/11 due to bright red fluid appearing like blood in the toilet after a stool. This led to her receiving roughly 5 units of pRBCs. After these 5 units she started urinating red urine and we became highly concerned for hyperhemolysis. She did not have any further stools so we did not think a GI bleed was likely.    She was given 1 dose of Eculizumab (Soliris) (4/12). This treatment is for complement mediated intravascular hyperhemolysis. Unfortunately it did not appear to help her.   On 4/14, we were thinking TTP could be contributory with numerous schistocytes on peripheral smear. Her T bili was up to 7.8, and her hemoglobin plasma was trending up, in the 380 -- > 610 and in the 800s today. Cr was worsening. Platelet count was dropping.  With her worsening condition and concern for both hyperhemolysis and possible TTP, we decided to start her plasma exchange followed by her second dose of Rituximab.  Unfortunately she became disoriented/confused following line placement and while receiving plasmaphoresis. CT head returned without acute findings. She then had an allergic reaction with a rash during PLEX which was stopped (4L completed with a goal of 5L). Improved with benadryl.  She was then administered rituximab. Then she developed worsening sinus tachycardia and HTN.   Her respiratory status deteriorated and she eventually required high-flow oxygen to maintain saturations > 90%. CXR showed bilateral opacities, not drastically changed from previous films. Rituximab was stopped halfway through its infusion in case this was an adverse effect to the drug. She was given 20 mg IV Lasix per the nighttime sign-out. She was initially given ceftriaxone and azithromycin IV to cover CAP but later ABx were broadened to vanc and Zosyn with rising lactate of unknown source.   Ultimately she had acute respiratory failure with hypoxia and need BiPAP. She was eventually intubated and a code blue was called.  She unfortunately died shortly after intubation.""

She has severe dementia but was doing OK and knew where she was.  She got the first vaccine on 1/29/21, and the 3rd and 4th day they noticed she was having hallucinations and saying things that weren't there.  She could hear baby's crying but there were no baby's present.   Within 7 days she had what the son described as a stroke. He said that she was watching television and he was on a conference call and he noticed she walked into a wall and he asked if she was okay and starting stumbling across the room and when he touched her she felt very heavy and said that one side of her face was drooping.  He got her back into the chair and called 9-1-1.  She was so agitated at the hospital that the husband does not know what they gave her and they kept her for a week.    They finally got her under control.  They discharged her from there and she that was all that they could do with her.  They brought her home with nurses assistance and her paranoia was evident, hallucinations were very evident. They said that they tried to do a CAT Scan and an MRI and they said that she did not have a stroke.   Restless was very adamant, talking strange things and wanting to go to her son's house when she was there.  Before that vaccination she knew where she was and after that she did not know where she was thinking she was at one location and just confusion.     She then got her 2nd vaccine and then her husband went out of town and took her back home on 2/24/21 as he was able to get her in a car and travel and able to eat and knew somewhat what was going on.  On 2/25/21 when he brought her home to  a long term care facility.  She was chanting constantly, had irritability, anger, cognition completely eroded.  She was very agitated, very combative.  Drugs would not calm her down, and tried to get CAT scans or MRI's but were unsuccessful due to her combativeness.  She was screaming and yelling 24 hours a day to the top of her lungs and gave her Ativan which had the adverse effects of what they were supposed to do.  Had biting, hallucinations, paranoia.   She had a couple of falls, they had her in a wheelchair and tried to feed her and she would fall down.  They took her to the hospital a few times and she progressively got worse.  On 4/19/21 she shut down and quit eating, quit drinking, closed her eyes, and lasted a week like that and then she died on 4/24/21 @ 2:30 AM.   None of her doctors could figure out what had happened.  They were finally able to get a CAT scan and felt that she may have a stroke.      Finally they memory care facility told them to come a take her to the hospital and they had moved their hospice patient's as she was screaming and disruptive and they could not handle her anymore.     They thought she was suffering from Lewy body dementia at one point.

Treatment team Severe sepsis (CMS/HCC) Principal problem Discharge Summary Internal Medicine    Inpatient DeathSummary   BRIEF OVERVIEW Admission Date: 4/6/2021     Discharge Date: 4/17/2021  DETAILS OF HOSPITAL STAY   Presenting Problem/History of Present Illness/Reason for Admission Patient is an 79 y.o. female morbidly obese with past medical history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia follow-up that was initially scheduled oncology follow-up for April 7 now postponed to the next 2 weeks, COPD on 2 L oxygen support at home, GERD, depression and anxiety.  She was recently seen in the ED on April 4, 2021 with complaint of shortness of breath, nonproductive cough, fever, chills, nonbloody diarrhea, vomiting and weakness and subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19.  She had however received a second dose of COVID-19 a week before and was  discharged home due to lack of significant findings on imaging chest x-ray and lack of requirement for higher  oxygen support. She presented to the emergency via EMS for evaluation of progressive shortness of breath with associated with fever, chills, headache, persistent shortness of breath, cough productive of thick clear sputum, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.  She denies abdominal pain, chest pain, or dizziness.  Denies recent antibiotic usage or recent travel.  Apparently, she thought she was getting better upon discharge after being kept for about 12 hours in the last ED visit, however she was not feeling well after going to bed last night and asked the husband to call 911.  Upon EMS arrival patient was saturating in the 80s and in respiratory distress.  She received 1 DuoNeb and was eventually placed on 10 L oxygen support.  She was noted to be in significant respiratory distress during speech.   Hospital Course Patient was admitted to hospital due to shortness of breath, and was found to have severe sepsis on presentation due to COVID-19 pneumonia.  She had evidence of acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure as well.  She was started on IV antibiotics, as well as remdesivir and Decadron at high dose.   Unfortunately she continued to have clinical deterioration, and ultimately required high flow oxygen therapy.  She was then transferred to the ICU, and ultimately required intubation due to severe profound ongoing hypoxia despite optimal medical treatment.  She did not respond to remdesivir or steroids or antibiotics.  Post intubation, she also developed acute renal failure during the course of her admission.   Multiple discussions were had throughout the hospitalization regarding goals of care, and initially patient and family wish to be continually aggressive.  She received full medical treatment, including life support, with minimal improvement.  Despite being on ventilator for roughly 5 days, she continued to have severe hypoxia.  She was proned, and was unable to sustain oxygen saturations when supine even for short period.   Her renal function continued to decline as well, and at that point discussion was had with family regarding goals of care again.  They were explained that symptoms continue to be persistent, and her illness continues to progress despite aggressive medical therapy.  Ultimately decision was made to not pursue dialysis, and to allow the patient to be kept comfortable and pass away naturally from this infection.   She was terminally extubated on 4/17 and passed away at 11:16 AM due to COVID-19 and acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure.

Ejection Fraction 55% (normal range 50-70%).   All wall segments showed normal motion.        Mild concentric LVH.                           Trivial aortic regurgitation.                  No additional significant valvular abnormality. No prior study for comparison.                 Presentation and History: Indication: The patient presents for evaluation of arrhythmia.  The patient has a history of obesity and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Findings: Procedure Information: Contrast agent, definity, is being given per protocol without apparent complications.  Due to technical limitations in the assessment of the left ventricle, imaging was performed after the administration of intravenous Definity echocontrast, as per protocol. Left Ventricle: The left ventricle is normal in size.  There is mildly increased left ventricular wall thickness.  The left ventricular systolic function is normal.  The visually estimated ejection fraction is 55% (normal range 50 70%). Wall Motion: All wall segments showed normal motion. Right Ventricle: RV not well visualized.  RV grossly normal in size and function by subcostal view. Atria: The left atrium is borderline dilated.  The right atrium is normal in size. Aortic Valve: Sclerotic appearing aortic valve with no significant aortic stenosis. Trivial aortic regurgitation. Mitral Valve: There is trace mitral valve regurgitation by color flow and doppler analysis.  There is no mitral valve stenosis by color flow and doppler analysis. Pulmonic Valve: There is no evidence of significant pulmonic valvular stenosis or insufficiency by color flow and doppler analysis. Tricuspid Valve: There is trace tricuspid valve regurgitation by color flow and doppler analysis. Great Vessels: All visible segments of the aorta are normal in size. Venous: The inferior vena cava is normal in size and collapses greater than 50% with inspiration. Pericardium/Pleural: There is no evidence of pericardial effusion.

The client was encourage to get vaccine and to keep appointment for Friday April 16th.  The client  emailed the office at approx 0300 Friday morning  April 16 to cancel appointment because she felt to poorly from vaccination shot to come in  (fevers; body aches). Dr next heard from police officer on Monday April 19th that she was found dead in her home. He requested the Medical Examiner (ME) evaluate but this request was denied. The client lived alone. Dr contacted family members but they did not have much interaction with the client and had no significant information to contribute. Dr said he speculates that the patients underlying anorexia nervosa likely put the client in a critical nutritional deficiencies / electrolyte imbalance condition and the side effects of vaccination were too much. He felt compelled to complete the death certificate as he did because the ME declined the case.   From vaccine mobile team notes:  team was there2-3:30pm.

She recovered easily from Covid19 back in November of 2020, along with several of her close friends and family members with no lingering effects.  On March 30th, she was given a single dose of the Moderna vaccine along with her teaching colleagues at a local high school. She initially complained of mild nausea and vomiting but quickly developed a severe headache prompting her to visit the local ER where she received treatment for a migraine. She returned to the ER at least one more time after no relief from the headache. By April 3rd,Saturday, she no longer recognized her sister nor knew what a mask was for.  Her family rushed her again to the same ER and she was subsequently transferred the following day to a Hospital.   Due to dangerously high intracranial pressure, she suffered a stroke with paralysis of her left side and a seizure.  Multiple lesions were noted on her brain via MRI. A shunt was inserted to relieve the pressure, she was intubated and placed into a deep coma from which she would never awaken.  Despite these medical interventions and pharmacological interventions, the pressure did not subside.  A craniotomy was performed the following Saturday as a last ditch effort to relieve the unrelenting pressure in her brain.  The craniotomy was able to reduce the pressure but it was too late.  There was no longer any brain activity and my cousin's daughter was removed from life support after they were able to say their goodbyes.     The medical examiner will be examining her brain to attempt to find a cause but that report may take 6 months."

Patient denies orthopnea or PND but does have some palpitations and occasional chest pain associated with increased fatigue with exertion. On evaluation emergency room patient was noted to be tachycardic consistent with chronic atrial fib, also acute renal insufficiency likely secondary to dehydration. Patient is admitted to the medical service for further treatment and evaluation. DEATH SUMMARY Date of Admission: 04/07/2021 Time of Death: 04/10/2021 at 0737 Final Diagnoses: 1. Sudden Cardiac Death 2. Acute Renal Impairment Secondary to Hypovolemia, A TN 3. Chronic Atrial Fibrillation w/ RVR, Resolved 4. Atypical Chest Pain, Resolved 5. Hypokalemia, Resolved 6. Obstructive Sleep Apnea 7. Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure Hospital Course: Patient is a pleasant 66yo admitted for acute renal impairment secondary to significant o hypovolemia resulting in ATN as well as atrial fibrillation w/ RVR after presenting to ER with complaints of chest pain, dyspnea, malaise, and anorexia that began after receiving his second COVID vaccine on 4/01/2021. Please see H&P for full details. Patient reported that on the day after his COVID #2 vaccine, he lost his appetite and was not able to eat or drink. He continued to take his home medications as prescribed including losartan, chlorthalidone, and meloxicam. After experiencing progressive worsening of symptoms for 5 days, patient presented to ER for further evaluation. Upon arrival to ER, patient was noted to be hypotensive and tachycardic. EKG showed atrial fibrillation w/ RVR. Routine labs were obtained and were remarkable for elevated creatinine and mild hypokalemia w/ normal BNP and negative cardiac enzymes. CXR showed enlarged cardiac silhouette, but no evidence of pulmonary edema or other acute abnormalities. Patient was subsequently admitted for further evaluation and medical management. He was staited on aggressive IV hydration for his hypotension and hypovolemia w/ PRN IV metoprolol as needed for HR> l lObpm. He was continued on anticoagulation. Serial cardiac enzymes were obtained and were negative. TIE report from Dr's office that was performed recently was obtained and showed EF of 55-60% with Grade 1 diastolic dysfunction. Patient's wife brought his CPAP from home and patient wore his CPAP while sleeping during his hospital stay. During the course of hospitalization, patient's blood pressure & HR improved, though he remained in atrial fibrillation. His creatinine continued to trend up consistent with ATN, but patient continued to produce adequate urine and he had no signficant electrolyte derangements. IVF were adjusted based on urine output and volume status. Patient had no recurrence in his presenting complaint of chest pain and he overall reported feeling better throughout his course of hospitalization despite reporting that he continued to have little appetite. Patient was monitored closely on telemetry throughout his hospital stay. On the morning of 4/10/2021, lab tech and nurse walked into the patient's room to obtain specimen for AM labs. Patient reportedly tried to get out of the bed independently, grabbed at his chest & pulled off his telemetry, and fell to his knees. Staff called Code 99 and patient was placed back in the bed. He was noted to be in asystole. ACLS was performed and despite maximal efforts, patient subsequently expired at 0737. I personally called the patient's cardiologist & personal friend, to discuss the events leading up to the patient's death. Upon review of the patient's course of hospitalization, it was felt that patient most likely experienced sudden cardiac death. Of note, Dr reports that the patient frequently contacts him via text message with concerns or complaints. He states that the patient did not message him during the hospitalization to report any chest pain or other concerns. Disposition: Patient Expired"	"I put the Death Summary on the Continuation Page.

The patient previously allergic to Cipro, clindamycin, doxycyclin, Lyrica, tetracycline. The patient previously was non-responder to hepatitis B vaccine. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2(PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 17Feb2021 for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient hasn't been treated with immunomodulating or immunosuppressing medications or received any other vaccines around the time of COVID-19 vaccination. The patient wasn't smoker/ former smoker. There was no any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. A nephrologist who reported patient in her hemodialysis unit who were vaccinated with BNT162b2 but were recently diagnosed with COVID-19. More detail is below on each patient. The patient COVID results were sent to the local health department for genetic sequencing (pending) and SARS titers were drawn (pending). Unfortunately, the HD unit does not have B/L information (although the B/L # was put on the patient's COVID vaccine cards, a record was not kept in the HD unit). Day she came in for dialysis she was already short of breath she said she'd had body aches for 5 days, got short of breath on 05Apr2021. The day before, started getting cough, nauseous, chills, abdominal discomfort on 04Apr2021. The patient was sent to the ER from dialysis and was admitted for SOB on 05Apr2021 and passed away on 09Apr2021 due to a GI bleed. Patient is over 500lbs so was unable to fit into hospital imaging equiment for CT scans or weight measurements. COVID-19 test was positive on 05Apr2021; the patient experienced COVID pneumonia on 05Apr2021. The patient admitted on 05Apr2021 to regular floor. The patient was moved to an Intensive Care Unit on 06Apr2021. The patient experienced short of breath on 05Apr2021 and required much more O2 than normal. Sometimes required BP support while on Dialysis and BP was 113/61 in ER. Pressure dropped to 100/70 and required mitrodrine after fluid was removed. The patient needed 4 liters supplemental O2 vs. only needing 2 liters at home. The patient experienced tachypnea and hypoxemia and no Respiratory failure. Respiration was 22. After 5 litres of O2 improved. Pulse 93 in ER. Cardiovascular: There was no heart failure, cardiogenic shock, Acute myocardial infarction, arrhythmia and myocarditis. The patient Had chest pain which resolved when O2 was administered. Gastrointestinal/Hepatic: There was no Vomiting, Diarrhea. The patient experienced nausea but no vomiting or diarrhea and complained of abdominal pain. There was no Jaundice and acute liver failure. Neurological: There was no altered consciousness, altered consciousness, encephalopathy, meningitis and cerebrovascular accident. The patient had headaches a couple days before admitting to ER. Hematological: There was no Thrombocytopenia, Disseminated intravascular coagulation. INR was 3 due to large dose of coumadin, and platelets were 180 and white count 6.8. Slight troponin increased at 0.37 at admittance, BNP 39. The patient started coughing up blood, having hemoxysis and bleeding on unspecified date. Laboratory test or diagnostic studies was reported that test for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR, or other commercial or public health assay. Xray showed vascular congestion with superimposed infiltrate which could represent pneumonia. Blood count was 11 and 36.7% at ER. Clinical chemistry: Sodium was 133; BUN was 68; Creatinine was 10. Evidence of hypoxemia: Pulse oO2 was 90 in ER.  CT scans: unknown results. Urinalysis: On dialysis so does not make urine. The patient had received Remdesivir, from 06Apr2021, Hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, Azithromycin from 06Apr2021 and Corticosteroids from 06Apr2021 for COVID-19.  The outcome of event ""GI bleed"" was fatal, the event ""chest pain"" and ""body aches"" was recovered and other events was unknown. The patient died on 09Apr2021. An autopsy was not performed.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender's Comments: Based on temporal association, a contributory role of the suspect drug cannot be excluded for the events vaccination failure, COVID-19, COVID-19 pneumonia, and sepsis. However, the patient's multiple medical comborbidities including renal failure requiring dialysis, lupus, and morbid obesity along with the risk of COVID-19 infection in light of the current pandemic are the more likely explanations for the development of these infections. The events gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hemorrhage, hemolysis and troponin increased are attributed to intercurrent medical conditions, and are considered unrelated to the suspect drug. The patient is currently on warfarin which may increase the risk for bleeds. This case will be reassessed upon receipt of additional information.

She told us he was completely find on the day of the vaccine. But the next morning around 9 am, she told us she has  severe abdominal pain, has the need to have a bowel movement, but she was defecated.

Speech is clear when she is speaking.  Sister gave patient water to drink.  She drank out of bottle and was able to hold on her own (though had difficulty with this at first).  Sister noted some water dripping down face, but was able to swallow okay.  Sister also noted that patient's lips seem to be pursed. Plan: Given recent concussion, and patients change in behavior per sister (pt more irritable, speaking more slowly, moving slowly, breathing faster, and wheezing), recommended patient be taken to the ED today--recommended ambulance since it took 2 men to help patient back to bed this morning.  Sister states patient is not agreeable to going to ED at this time.  Advised to try to encourage her to drink more fluids, and continue to monitor her sxs, and if any worsening, to call for ambulance transport.

The (Name) mother also blamed the vaccine for the sudden death of her ""healthy"" daughter. While a post-mortem was expected to be held to learn more about her death, some of the family members believed she simply suffered a heart attack, while her mother was connecting her sudden death to the vaccine. The patient died in Apr2021. It was not reported if an autopsy was performed.

The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

He had a telemedicine appointment scheduled that morning for another matter. The doctor took one look at him and said we should have him evaluated asap. I took him to the emergency room at Hospital. They did some tests and said he was septic and immediately put him into the ICU.  He was started on IV antibiotics while the blood cultures were growing out.  It was determined that the bacteria was Strep G but they were unable to identify the source.  He was put on a ventilator and an echo cardiogram was done.  It was believed that the source of the infection was his pacemaker and I was told the pacemaker would have to be removed.  They couldn't do it at that hospital.

It was believed by some doctors that the source of infection was the injection site.  The infection was cleared from his body and the ventilator was removed after 2 weeks.

A 96-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 28Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EP6955) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Leukaemia in 2018, High blood pressure with 40 years, Diabetes in 2016, Atrial fibrillation in 2018.The patient's concomitant medications were not reported. Patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Batch/lot number: EN6199) in left arm on 07Mar2021 for COVID-19 immunization. She had just had her blood drawn in Feb2021 and her blood was ok. So on 07Mar2021 she received her first Covid 19 vaccine. At 96 years old, after the Covid 19 vaccine, her mother's body was full blown with leukemia. Radiation wasn't an option to stop the overproducing of her white blood cells. The Covid 19 vaccine just accelerated it. Maybe there are others out there in this condition and should be double checking to see if they should get the Covid 19 vaccine.  On the 12Apr2021 or 13Apr2021 her mother started having a hollow cough. She wasn't congested but she continued to cough. She noticed her mother was breathing heavy and fighting to breathe on Friday, on16Apr2021. It wasn't getting any better and she thought her mother would have more trouble so she took her to the emergency room. She reported she took her mother to the hospital on 16Apr2021.She was admitted on 16Apr2021 and discharged on 18Apr2021. They gave her some oxygen and did some tests. They asked her mother if she had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and she did not, they suggested that it was her atrial fibrillation. She has had atrial fibrillation in the past, her doctor did leave her on her atrial fibrillation medication. She can't recall the name of the atrial fibrillation medication. She was discharged home on 18Apr2021 and she was breathing ok on her own. But by that next Tuesday, 20Apr2021, she noticed her mother was declining. She wasn't acting like herself. On Wednesday, 21Apr2021, she was more tired and her difficulty breathing started back up. On Thursday, 22Apr2021, she called the ambulance to take her mother to the hospital. She could tell that her mother wasn't herself, she could hardly talk on 22Apr2021 , she couldn't stand up, she lost control of her bowels. She wasn't responding to her. The caller knew something was going on. They put oxygen on her mother and they transferred her to a cancer specialist hospital. That's when the doctor realized it was a leukoblast. Clarified with caller, leukoblast. Then her mother died. She died on 28Apr2021.The caller knows the hospital was doing tests to see what was causing her mother's pain, but she doesn't have that information. She heard the screams from her mother and there was no consoling her mother. The hospital gave her mother morphine and it didn't work. She has no product information for the morphine, it was given in the hospital. She was screaming for murder, screaming for help and was given the morphine. Within a month of receiving the Covid 19 vaccine her leukemia was back and her mother was screaming in agony and pain because her sides were blowing up in pain. Whatever the Covid 19 vaccine did in her body, her body thought it was fighting off something. She had no red blood cells that could provide oxygen to her organs. She was weak. Overproducing of her white blood cells on an unspecified date. The lab data included White blood cell count abnormal and Red blood cell count decreased. Outcome of her mother's body was full blown with leukemia/she wasn't responding was fatal, of remaining events was unknown. Treatment received for all events. The seriousness of event breathing heavy and fighting to breathe were reported as hospitalization from 16Apr2021 to 18Apr2021.

An 81-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration at the age of 81-year-old in Jan2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included bladder cancer. The patient's concomitant medications were not reported.  Caller states ''My sister and I both received the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. My sister developed Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration two weeks after receiving the Pfizer vaccine. They did find a half cm tumor in her fallopian tube. Her doctors have reported the side effect but at that time she was not fully diagnosed. They thought at that time it was meningitis .'' Caller wants to know if Meningitis or Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration has been associated with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Response: Spoke from the attached document. These two disorders have not been listed as side effects associated with the vaccine. However we may not have the list of all the possible side effects associated with the vaccine. Caller was reporting side effects for her sister related to the Covid 19 vaccine. Her sister had received the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine and 2 weeks later developed a disorder called Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration. They had found a tumor in the fallopian tube that was a tiny half centimeter tumor. Said that the doctors had reported the side effects but at the time it was not yet diagnosed as paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration. At the time, they thought she had meningitis. The event happened about 2 weeks after the vaccine, so about 11Feb2021, was about 2 weeks before or 2 and a half weeks before 11Feb2021 that she got the vaccine. She was in the hospital 10 and a half weeks (about for 74 days). She contacted Pfizer, she believes in Mar2021. Since Feb2021 she had been in 3 different hospitals. They did send her some paperwork but she has not completed it yet. At that point in Mar2021 her diagnosis was meningitis. As it later turns out, it turned to a new diagnosis of the Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration. Her sister lives in PRIVACY, she does not even know where she went for the vaccine. She hasn't filed the written report yet. She was not diagnosed with the Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration until the very end, 10 days before she died. She died on 24Apr2021. Cause of death: They had removed her ovaries and fallopian tubes had the suspicion that this might have been the diagnosis without ever seeing the tumor. She had multiple CT scans (2021) and never saw the tumor until they removed the fallopian tubes. They found a 1.5cm tumor in the fallopian tubes which is what the cause of death was. She was calling to see if this has happened to anyone else. They say the tumor was the cause because it would have been so odd that it came on so suddenly, 2 weeks after the vaccine. The caller is terrified to get the vaccine, since she had bladder cancer. She had asked if anyone had reported this because that was the diagnosis at the time. They did not do an autopsy, probably because that was up to her brother in law and can understand why an autopsy was not done. They also say when her sister was having all of these bizarre symptoms, it was an auto immune reaction. She was perfectly fine and had come home from a bird watch. She had severe headache, eyes would move back and forth involuntarily in 2021. That never went away. She had severe vertigo in 2021, and it all happened in one day, it didn't go away. They did an immunoglobulin infusion treatment, she had very good treatment. They put her on steroids. The immunoglobulin treatment was for five days and nothing touched those symptoms. They had moved her from one hospital to a rehab facility in PRIVACY. The rehab doctor reported all of these symptoms to Pfizer. At that time, they were still calling it meningitis. He said that the elephant in the room was the vaccine. Felt the vaccine is not totally what caused it but accelerated what ever was going on with her, these bizarre disorders. Maybe this would have happened without the vaccine. They will never know. She wishes that someone can tell her whether or not she should get the vaccine.

Though chronically ill, he was not sick at the time, which was 4 days after the vaccine. He walked up the stairs, collapsed at the top, walked again to the chair, collapsed and then made his way into the chair where he told me ""I can't breathe."" and then slumped over. My mom and I lifted his limp body up and noticed he was not breathing.  We moved him to the floor and started life support measures. About 5 minutes later the paramedics arrived.  They were eventually able to get his heart and breathing going again about 14 minutes later.  He was moved to critical care.  After it became apparent he suffered irreparable brain damage, I stopped the life support measures (ventilator) and he passed away shortly after on Friday the 9th. They were continuously removing blood from his lungs while he was there. There was no indication he would die prior to this incident. Though we attempted to tell the critical care doctors about his recent vaccination, they were not receptive to the suggestion that this may have caused the incident that proceeded his passing. My mom did try the heimlich and there were indications that he had breathed in vomit, but he had stopped breathing before this and therefore his cause of death WAS NOT aspiration. He also had fallen the day after the vaccination (Saturday) and the notes indicated his broken ribs were from the CPR measures but this is in error as well as he had broken his ribs in the fall. It is my opinion the broken ribs caused a bruise in the lungs, the vaccination caused excessive clotting, and when he was coughing shortly before the incident it loosened the clots that then caused a pulmonary embolism.""

An 80-year-old male patient of unspecified age and gender received the first/second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number and expiration date unknown) via intramuscular at left arm on 02Feb2021 10:00 (80-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient's medical history included Stents from 2005 (a stent placed in 2005; a heart attack in 2017 and additional 5 stents were placed in 2017; a stent placed in his neck in Nov2019); Heart attack from 2017; Reaction to contrast dye from 2005 (has a reaction to the dye that they use for stents; had a stent placed in 2005 and had a reaction to the dye then; a mild heart attack in 2017 and did stents; once again had a reaction to the contrast dye); Sensitivity to bug bites (When the patient got big bites, you would think someone had beat him he had so many knots; the last few years the patient's reaction to bug bites got much worse); High blood pressure. Additional information for other conditions: The patient was very highly allergic or has a reaction to the dye that they use for stents. The patient had some heart stents and he had bad reactions to the contrast used. The patient was allergic to different things. The patient couldn't take codeine. When the patient got big bites, you would think someone had beat him he had so many knots. Reaction to contrast dye: the patient's physicians then wanted to do imaging with contrast dye on the patient's neck. Physician put the patient on a cocktail for 24-48 hours before the stent was placed and the patient still had a reaction. The patient was given a cocktail of Benadryl and 2 other medications that she cannot remember. The patient's reaction to the dye was not as bad as the first 2 but he still had one. The patient had the stent placed in his neck in Nov2019. The patient still had a reaction to the contrast dye, a mild reaction, even with the cocktail. The reaction was enough the patient was told to continue taking the medication afterward. The patient always carried a nitro bottle in his pocked but he never took any of them. They asked how the nitro tablets were and they were powder. They were blessed as far as the patient's heart. Concomitant medications included cetirizine taken for allergy problems; amlodipine taken for high blood pressure for years; acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN) (for the arteries, just to keep the blood thin, the patient began taking aspirin after experiencing side effects from Effient). The patient previously received codeine and experienced sensitivity (Couldn't take codeine, goes way back, 40-50 years). The patient previously received prasugrel hydrochloride (EFFIENT) from 2017 and experienced shortness of breath (The patient was put on Effient after his stent placement in 2017. Doctor took the patient off of Effient and instructed him to just take aspirin because the patient was showing side effects of shortness of breath and different things. Doctor informed the patient that he would rather the patient just take Aspirin than have the side effects from Effient). The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number and expiration date unknown) at left arm on 12Jan2021 (80-year-old at time of vaccination) for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced ""so excited"" (the patient was so excited after the first shot of the COVID-19 vaccine). The patient previously received tetanus vaccine toxoid (TETANUS) shot for immunisation (20 years ago at least) and experienced ""Couldn't move arm, arm swelled and turned red and was messed up for a while"". Prior vaccinations within 4 weeks was none. Patient's wife reported that she and her husband (the patient) took the COVID-19 vaccines on 12Jan2021 and 02Feb2021. After his second dose, the patient kept telling her that he didn't feel good and that he was tired (from 03Feb2021). The patient just did not feel good. The patient was cold and so cold to the touch (from 03Feb2021). On 03Feb2021, he was dragging. The patient just wanted to stay down and didn't want to get up. She asked the patient if this was going to keep him in the room all day. The patient replied that he just couldn't wake up. The patient was tired and cold and couldn't get warm. The patient lost 30 pounds (in Feb2021) after he got the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient walked around holding his pants up. The patient would eat very little and he didn't like to eat. When he was weighed at the doctor on Friday 02Apr2021, he weighed 136 pounds fully clothed. The patient normally weighed 150-160 pounds. The patient had lost a lot of weight. The patient's color was off, stating that one of her friends said the patient looked grey. The patient experienced pressure in lower stomach (in Feb2021). The patient told her that in his lower stomach, he described it as pressure, and the patient thought he was just kind of sore from coughing from the sinus infection. The patient couldn't stand clothes to touch him and would cut holes in his underwear elastic so that it wouldn't press into him. The patient went to the doctor twice from the time he took the second shot of the COVID-19 vaccine to his death (on 04Apr2021). The patient went to the clinic. The clinic thought the patient had a sinus infection (from 27Mar2021) and gave him a shot that would make him feel good. The patient got a shot on 27Mar2021. She wasn't sure what the shot was and she didn't get a print out. They treated the sinus infection with amoxicillin-clavulanate (875mg-125mg, manufacturer is Teun). The amoxicillin hadn't worked well and the patient went back to the clinic a second time on Friday, 02Apr2021. When the patient went to the doctor on 02Apr2021, they were unable to get a register on the finger pulse-ox monitor. The patient's physician did an X-ray (on 02Apr2021) and the X-ray was perfectly fine (normal). Nothing showed up on the X-ray at all. The patient passed away easter Sunday morning (04Apr2021). The cause of death listed on the patient's death certificate is due to consequence or problem of pulmonary embolism (from 04Apr2021), respiratory impairment. The patient did not receive an autopsy. The family didn't feel the need and the staff didn't even ask if the family wanted an autopsy. ""When you live to be 80 years old, you're blessed."" HCP: The patient's heart doctor did not see the patient on 04Apr2021 before he died. The last time the patient saw the doctor was Dec2020. The wife reported that she is not complaining, the patient made the decision to take the shot, she is just concerned that the patient had something that could help someone else. The wife stated she was not trying to complain at all, she took the COVID-19 vaccine right beside him and had no consequences. She didn't even have a sore arm. The family is just concerned that there is an ingredient in the COVID-19 vaccine or something that could trigger that in them. Yesterday, 23Jun2021, they were showing a lady on TV that was so sick (unable to provide details). ""The patient"" (unknown to which patient this is referring) got the shot and ended up in the hospital with side effects. The wife reported that's why she wanted to let Pfizer know about her husband. She was just reporting the patient's symptoms and was not wanting to hurt anyone's feelings in the world. She is not blaming the COVID-19 vaccine for the patient's death, and stated that it could have been his heart or more anything. She just felt like she needed to let pfizer know some of the side effects the patient was having that didn't start until after the second COVID-19 shot. The wife unable to provide the NDC number, lot number, or expiry date of the patient's COVID-19 vaccines. She does not have the information but her son does have that if Pfizer wanted to call and talk to him. The adverse events did not require a visit to emergency room; the adverse events requiref a visit to physician office (The patient went to the clinic 27Mar2021 and went back 02Apr2021 for Sinus infection). Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event sinus infection and included a shot and amoxicillin-clavulanate. The outcome of the event pulmonary embolism/ respiratory impairment was fatal; outcome of other events was unknown. The patient died on 04Apr2021. No autopsy was done.

"1. The full results are too long to be displayed, only non-zero rows are available."
"2. VAERS data in CDC WONDER are updated every Friday. Hence, results for the same query can change from week to week."
"3. These results are for 1,092 total events."
"4. When grouped by VAERS ID, results initially don't show Events Reported, Percent, or totals. Use Quick or More Options to"

"---"
Footnotes:
"1. Submitting a report to VAERS does not mean that healthcare personnel or the vaccine caused or contributed to the adverse"
"event (possible side effect)."
"---"
Caveats:
"1. <p> VAERS accepts reports of adverse events and reactions that occur following vaccination. Healthcare providers, vaccine"
"manufacturers, and the public can submit reports to VAERS. While very important in monitoring vaccine safety, VAERS reports"
"alone cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness. The reports may contain"
"information that is incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental, or unverifiable. Most reports to VAERS are voluntary, which means they"
"are subject to biases. This creates specific limitations on how the data can be used scientifically. Data from VAERS reports"
"should always be interpreted with these limitations in mind. </p> <p> The strengths of VAERS are that it is national in scope"
"and can quickly provide an early warning of a safety problem with a vaccine. As part of CDC and FDA's multi-system approach to"
"post-licensure vaccine safety monitoring, VAERS is designed to rapidly detect unusual or unexpected patterns of adverse events,"
"also known as ""safety signals."" If a safety signal is found in VAERS, further studies can be done in safety systems such as"
"the CDC's Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) or the Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) project. These systems do not have"
"the same limitations as VAERS, and can better assess health risks and possible connections between adverse events and a vaccine."
"</p> <p> Key considerations and limitations of VAERS data: <ul><li> Vaccine providers are encouraged to report any clinically"
"significant health problem following vaccination to VAERS, whether or not they believe the vaccine was the cause. </li><li>"
"Reports may include incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental and unverified information. </li><li> The number of reports alone"
"cannot be interpreted or used to reach conclusions about the existence, severity, frequency, or rates of problems associated"
"with vaccines. </li><li> VAERS data are limited to vaccine adverse event reports received between 1990 and the most recent date"
"for which data are available. </li><li> VAERS data do not represent all known safety information for a vaccine and should be"
"interpreted in the context of other scientific information. </li></ul> </p>"
"2."
"3. Some items may have more than 1 occurrence in any single event report, such as Symptoms, Vaccine Products, Manufacturers, and"
"Event Categories. If data are grouped by any of these items, then the number in the Events Reported column may exceed the total"
"number of unique events. If percentages are shown, then the associated percentage of total unique event reports will exceed 100%"
"in such cases. For example, the number of Symptoms mentioned is likely to exceed the number of events reported, because many"
"reports include more than 1 Symptom. When more than 1 Symptom occurs in a single report, then the percentage of Symptoms to"
"unique events is more than 100%. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/vaers.html#Suppress."
"4. Data contains VAERS reports processed as of 09/10/2021. The VAERS data in WONDER are updated weekly, yet the VAERS system"
"receives continuous updates including revisions and new reports for preceding time periods. Duplicate event reports and/or"
"reports determined to be false are removed from VAERS. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/vaers.html#Reporting."
"5. Values of Event Category field vary in their availability over time due to changes in the reporting form. The ""Emergency"
"Room/Office Visit"" value was avaliable only for events reported using the VAERS-1 form, active 07/01/1990 to 06/29/2017. The"
"""Congenital Anomaly/Birth Defect"", ""Emergency Room"", and ""Office Visit"" values are available only for events reported"
"using the VAERS 2.0 form, active 06/30/2017 to present. These changes must be considered when evaluating count of events for"
"these categories."
"6. About COVID19 vaccines: <UL><LI> For more information on how many persons have been vaccinated in the US for COVID19 to date,"
"see https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations/: <a target= .. </LI><LI> One report may state that the patient"
"received more than one brand of COVID-19 vaccine on the same visit. This is a reporting error, but explains why the total number"
"of reports may not equal the total number of COVID-19 vaccine doses. </LI></UL>"
