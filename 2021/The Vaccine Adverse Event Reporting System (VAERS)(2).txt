Patient previously able to ambulate with significant limp and hyperextension of right knee, but mostly wheelchair bound over last several years as he had had a slow and steady decline in overall health and mobility. Patient developed aggressive behavior of shouting ""hey"" and grabbing of groin in 2016. This was worked up with CT scans, labs, referral to urology, neurology, and referrals to psychiatry. The exact etiology of this action was never able to be affirmed, but thought to be more psychiatrically related. It improved significantly with addition of antipsychotics, worsened when antipsychotics were reduced, and improved again with addition of injectable antipsychotic on 12-10-2020.Patient suffered from falls on occasion given his significantly impaired physical mobility. His last documented fall was 8-31-2019. Patient began utilizing wheelchair most of time following that fall. No significant injuries noted in documentation of the falls. In the last 3 months, patient would often refuse medications. He would sometimes indicate that they would cause dizziness, and other times he would simply refuse. We attempted to hide medications in his food/fluid (with wife's blessing) and when he detected this he would occasionally refuse to eat. Patient previously on DOAC. After pharmacy review in 12/2020 it was recommended to discontinue this as no clear indication to continue use. He was high fall risk and would often refuse this medication as well since 10/2020. Noted to be in NSR on EKGs and decision made to discontinue the DOAC. Patient had no evidence of adverse effects noted after vaccination on December 28th.

Additionally, the site informed us both (as I was with him to get the injection) that this was all normal and not to seek medical attention unless these symptoms last longer than 72 hours. That evening, my dad was experiencing all of those symptoms, and went to bed at 7pm. A little after 10am on Wednesday, January 13, 2021, when he awoke, my dad went to the bathroom vomiting. This was where he collapsed and went into cardiac arrest. Fire/Rescue was dispatched about 10:30am after my mom started CPR. County Fire Rescue EMTs and Paramedics continued CPR and other attempts at reviving him all the way to Hospital Emergency Department. He was pronounced dead at 12:14pm on Wednesday, January 13, 2021.

According to the paramedics, the patient was dead longer than when his wife found him, and no resuscitation was performed.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not applicable.  The outcome of the events, feverish, body aches, loss of appetite, was considered resolved. The patient died on 09 Jan 2021. The cause of death was not reported.  The reporter assessed the event, death, as not related to Moderna's COVID-19 Vaccine. The reporter did not provide assessment for the events, feverish and body aches, in relation to Moderna's COVID-19 Vaccine.; Reporter's Comments: This case concerns a 65 year old male patient with medical history of diabetes, hypertension, Hashimoto's, smoker, cataracts, atrioventricular block, occasional premature ventricular contractions, and hypertriglyceridemia, who experienced the serious unexpected event of death, non-serious unexpected event of loss of appetite, and non-serious expected events of fever and body pain.  The event of death occurred 5 days after the first dose of mRNA-1273. The events of fever, body pain and loss of appetite occurred an unspecified period of time after the first dose of mRNA-1273.  Very limited information regarding these events has been provided at this time.  Based on temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.   Definitive causal association is confounded by age and medical history of diabetes, hypertension, Hashimoto's, smoker, cataracts, atrioventricular block, occasional premature ventricular contractions, and hypertriglyceridemia."

Medical history included Alzheimer's and others. No known allergies. Concomitant medications included unspecified medications. The reporter's mother in law was tested for COVID-19 at a nursing facility on 25Dec2020 and she was negative. On 02Jan2021, she received the first dose of Pfizer vaccine. On 04Jan2020, she developed a high fever, needed oxygen and was positive for COVID-19. Date of death was 04Jan2021. The cause of her death was listed as pneumonia, respiratory failure and COVID-19. No autopsy performed. No treatment received. No one knew if the vaccination contributed to her death. It was hard to know if her death was due to the administration of the vaccine or it exacerbated the COVID19 symptoms which led to her death. Since this was unknown, it could have been a possibility. The reporter wanted to give us this information because we might want to consider having high risk population, patients with underlying conditions, older population tested for COVID-19 prior to the vaccination, as this is not currently a recommendation or a requirement. All is very new and they are all learning so the reporter wanted to share this information with us. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. There are medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was fatal.   Information about Lot/Batch has been requested.; Sender's Comments: The association between the fatal event lack of effect (pneumonia, respiratory failure and COVID-19) with BNT162b2 can not be fully excluded.

The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient received the vaccine on 04Jan2021, after which he started not feeling well. He went right home and went to bed. He woke up and ate a bit but not much and then was kind of pale. The patient then started to vomit, which continued throughout the night. He was having trouble in breathing. Emergency services were called, and they took his vitals and said that everything was okay, but he was very agitated; reported as not like this prior to the vaccine. The patient was taken to urgent care where they gave him an unspecified steroid shot and unspecified medication for vomiting. The patient was told he was probably having a reaction to the vaccine, but he was just dried up. The patient continued to vomit throughout the day and then he was very agitated again and would fall asleep for may be 15-20 minutes. When the patient woke up, he was very restless (reported as: his body was just amped up and could not calm down). The patient calmed down just a little bit in the evening. When the patient was awoken at 6:00 AM in the morning, he was still agitated. The patient stated that he couldn't breathe, and his mind was racing.

The reporter stated that she was ""not calling to complaining.""   The reporter stated that there was nothing wrong with her dad. He was elderly with no health issues.  ""He was literally on no medications. The only reason he was in the nursing home was because he was afraid to walk."" The reporter stated that she received a call about giving the patient the vaccine and she said yes because she wanted him to have the vaccine. One week after the vaccine, the patient tested positive for COVID ""like all the other people"" (no further details provided). The reporter stated that her dad had no symptoms of COVID.

I met with the director of the facility and she directed me to where my team would be setting up.  My team consisted of (technician), (nurse) and I. As we were setting up, the director asked how she can help. I explained to her that we would need a designated area for patients to be monitored after vaccination for 15 minutes and maybe even longer . I also explained that we would need one of her staff monitoring while we vaccinate. She agreed, and proceeded to designate her staff and the cafeteria area, facing the vaccination station,the monitoring station.   Throughout the day, nurse and I were both vaccinating,while the staff of the facility would monitor the vaccinated patients. I would also stop occasionally to mix the vaccine and check the temperature of the aero safe.   At approximately 12:50pm, the director rushed in and stated that a patient is not responding, and that she had been vaccinated. At that point, I grabbed epipens and a thermometer and I also instructed nurse to grab an Epipen and come with me. We followed the director to pt's room. Once we got to the room, the patient was in bed and there were 4 staff members standing bedside and one of them turned and stated the patient has passed. At that point I asked the staff how long ago did the patient get the vaccine, they stated about 30 minutes ago. They also stated that the patient was a hospice patient and that the patient had declined, and was rapidly detiorating and had not eaten or drank anything all day . They also stated that the patient had been monitored for 15 minutes post vaccination. I then left the room and grabbed the patients COVID Vaccine intake consent form.     I looked at the answered questionaire and all the responses were circled NO. Patient had a temp of 96.5 at the time of vaccination.The vaccine administration information for Immunizer Section was filled out by Nurse. I then proceeded to ask the director once again if there were staff that was monitoring her for 15 minutes, the director stated they had staff monitoring her. She also stated the Hospice nurse has to announce her death, so they waited for the Hospice Nurse to come.  I then called Corporate and explained the situation. After speaking to corporate, I also asked nurse, if she remembered the patient. She stated that she did and at the time of the vaccination the patient was not alert, there were two staff members with the patient. She was non oriented and she kept closing her eyes. At that point, Nurse stated that she asked the two staff members with her if this is how she usually is and if its ok to vaccinate her. Both Staff members stated that it its ok,this is how she is. The Nurse then proceeded to vaccinate.  At approximately 3:10pm, as I was leaving I spoke to the director, and one of her Staff members. Staff that the patient has actually not eaten/ or drank anything for the past several days, including today(01/18/21). Staff also stated that on Friday, Jan 15th,2021, they had informed the family that the patient was rapidly detiorating. Staff also stated that the family knowingly gave the consent to vaccinate her. She also stated that the hospice Nurse believes that the death was primarily caused by her detiorating state. She also stated that the hospice Nurse informed that the death was not due to the Vaccine. Per Lead Pharmacist at the clinic."	"No lab data for this event."

Former smoker, quit 12+ yrs ago. 11/1/20-11/6/20: Hospitalized for acute on chronic back pain, found to multiple hypermetabolic lesions in the axial skeleton. Diagnosed with epithelioid angiosarcoma. Patient discharged to facility. 12/17/20: Patient received his 1st COVID-19 vaccine w/o complications at facility. 12/21/20: Underwent cyberknife treatment. 12/31/20: Transferred from facility to ER for new O2 requirement, SOB, cough, chest X ray / pulm edema, tachycardic and new periorbital edema. 12/31/20: Admitted to ICU before transfer to acute care. 1/1/21: Pulmonary consult, ""Labs are notable for progressive left shift with bandemia, markedly elevated inflammatory markers (D-dimer, ESR, CRP, ferritin, LDH), mild elevation in procalcitonin, mild elevation in lactate that has improved, and negative viral panel including COVID-19 x2. CT chest is notable for b/l GGOs along with some interstitial infiltrates with an upper and particularly mid zone and perihilar predominance, septal thickening and crazy paving, and numerous cystic lesions or pneumatoceles. There is a lack of lobar consolidation and pulmonary nodules. Of note, PET/CT about 2 months ago only demonstrated some mild to moderate emphysema mostly in the upper lobes. Therefore, there has been a relatively dramatic change in a few months, suggesting a more subacute process, rather than an acute infectious process such as a viral pneumonia, including COVID-19 infection, in which the GGOs tend to be subpleural and peripheral. Overall, our suspicion for COVID-19 is relatively low, with negative testing x2 yesterday, negative testing a few weeks ago, and lack of sick contacts, but it is possible. Therefore, higher on the differential is a more subacute infection or chemotherapy-induced pneumonitis. Risk factors include malignancy, chemotherapy, and use of steroids (equivalence of about 27 mg of Prednisone in the form of Dexamethasone since 11/6/20 without PJP prophylaxis). These risk factors, along with consistent imaging and elevated LDH, make PJP quite likely. Fungal infection is less likely based on imaging. Chemotherapy-induced pneumonitis is a possibility, especially given the more subacute picture based on imaging. Both Gemcitabine and Docetaxel can cause pneumonitis. However, the patient has been on steroids, which is used to treat drug-induced pneumonitis, although this does not exclude it completely."" 1/2/21: Transferred to ICU for worsening hypoxemia as patient reached 40L/100% FIO2 and remained on COVID isolation/COVID patient under investigation per ID recommendation. 1/4/21: Isolation precautions discontinued due to lower suspicion for active COVID infection to explain current presentation 1/6/21: Went into atrial fibrillation w/o RVR overnight 1/6. Tolerating, with MAPs in low 60s and HR in high 90s/low 100s. Suspect due to being-1L yesterday from diuresis, lasix stopped. S/p amiodarone bolus + drip, albumin 5% bolus 1/5/21: Macrocytic anemia NOS w/ slowly worsening H/H s/p PRBC x 1 unit 1/7/21: Per ICU Life-sustaining treatment note, ""Following discussion w/ patient that his lung dx has been refractory to txt and hasn't improved despite maximal therapy, patient agreed to transition to hospice after he settles affairs. "" 1/7/21 Infectious Disease note: ""This is an immunocompromised host due to cancer on active chemotherapy (albeit ANC>4000 on admission) and notably had been on daily PO dexamethasone 1 mg TID (total daily dose 3 mg, equivalent to 20 mg PO prednisone) since 11/6/20 without any PJP ppx. There was elevated c/f COVID-19 infection in setting of patient's presenting symptoms, especially in conjunction with b/l GGOs on imaging. Has undergone multiple COVID test that have all resulted negative. Discussed radiographic findings with radiology colleagues, and overall, it is difficult to definitively narrow the differential with imaging alone, but overall density of GGOs seem to appear less likely PJP and more in line with chemical pneumonitis vs COVID, although less typical for viral pneumonia as well. Given false-negative COVID tests are not unheard of, especially in the immunocompromised population, patient was kept on isolation precautions as a PUI for abundance of caution. He is now off precautions. In setting of patient having been on prednisone for some time without PJP ppx, he was also started on treatment dose TMP/SMX. Beta-d-glucan has returned positive, and although not the ideal test for PJP, this can certainly support a potential dx of PJP. Unfortunately, DFA from sputum was not performed due to insufficient sample and currently the patient is unable to produce an additional sample for testing. He is tolerating the high-dose TMP/SMX; we adjusted the dose to three SS tablets TID based on his somewhat declining UOP. Other fungal etiologies are pending work-up as well. Lastly, patient's chemotherapy is known to cause pneumonitis, but per pulmonology team, he receives prophylactic dexamethasone with his chemo cycles that should help to prevent drug-induced pneumonitis. Remains on the differential for now and this should also be concurrently treated with the steroids he is receiving."" 1/10/21: Comfort care initiated. All non-comfort measures were discontinued.

An 85-year-old male patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 21Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included blood pressure abnormal (verbatim: blood pressure) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, neuropathy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, weight issue from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, diabetes from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, walker user from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  Concomitant medications included insulin aspart (NOVOLOG) taken for diabetes from an unspecified date to an unspecified date; and he was taking a long acting one as well. The patient previously received the influenza vaccine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) for immunization on unknown dates (""had flu shots before with no reactions and everything, nothing before""). On 24Jan2021, the patient's heart stopped (death, medically significant), and could not swallow (medically significant).  The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient's wife stated the patient was taking insulin aspart (NOVOLOG) and he was taking a long acting one as well. The reporter, the patient's wife and a retired registered nurse (RN) stated, her husband (patient) just died and she thought he died from the COVID vaccine (later clarified the reason of death was-heart stopped). The patient had the vaccine on 21Jan2021, which was on a Thursday, and he was fine. On the following Sunday around 1:30 (on 24Jan2021), the patient was feeling a little weak, however, the patient's wife thought maybe his blood sugar was low. The patient's wife checked, and the patient's blood sugar was 91. The patient's wife went to get some yogurt to feed him in order to get his blood sugar up a little; ""which was a normal thing for him, it was not that low for him."" Then, suddenly, the patient fell, and the patient's wife could not get a pulse or anything. The patient's wife called an unspecified number and she started compressions; however, he was dead. The patient's wife stated the patient just had his heart test, a three hour long one, and it was ""perfect three weeks ago."" The patient had just gone to the doctor the other day and his blood pressure was ""fine and everything."" The patient's wife stated that other than his diabetes, ""which he had for (sentence incomplete)."" Regarding lab tests, the patient's wife stated, ""No, he had it before but not in the last two weeks. He was going for one because we just went to the doctor last week and he was going to call yesterday to make the appointment request to get his blood work done. Blood work has been good except his A1C was always high, but other than that everything was good"" (as reported). Regarding causality, the patient's wife stated, ""I do, because he was fine until about half an hour before he died. He said to me, I feel a little weak today and then I was talking to him that your upper body strength is really good and then I said, we just have to work on your weight a little more because he did have neuropathy. And then, I went out of the room and all of a sudden I just heard him fall and that is when I just went in to check his blood sugar and it was 91 and I got him yogurt and he started eating that and then that was it, he started spitting it out and he said, I could not swallow and that was it, he just died.""  The patient's wife further added, ""I just wanted other people to know that things like this happen and I am sure it was from that because he was healthy as could be. He was walking with his walker, the day before outside and he felt fine."" The clinical outcome of the event, heart stopped, was fatal. The clinical outcome of the event, could not swallow, was unknown. The patient died on 24Jan2021 due to ""heart stopped.""  An autopsy was not performed.

"2. VAERS data in CDC WONDER are updated every Friday. Hence, results for the same query can change from week to week."
"3. These results are for 733 total events."

"---"
Footnotes:
"1. Submitting a report to VAERS does not mean that healthcare personnel or the vaccine caused or contributed to the adverse"
"event (possible side effect)."
"---"
Caveats:
"1. <p> VAERS accepts reports of adverse events and reactions that occur following vaccination. Healthcare providers, vaccine"
"manufacturers, and the public can submit reports to VAERS. While very important in monitoring vaccine safety, VAERS reports"
"alone cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness. The reports may contain"
"information that is incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental, or unverifiable. Most reports to VAERS are voluntary, which means they"
"are subject to biases. This creates specific limitations on how the data can be used scientifically. Data from VAERS reports"
"should always be interpreted with these limitations in mind. </p> <p> The strengths of VAERS are that it is national in scope"
"and can quickly provide an early warning of a safety problem with a vaccine. As part of CDC and FDA's multi-system approach to"
"post-licensure vaccine safety monitoring, VAERS is designed to rapidly detect unusual or unexpected patterns of adverse events,"
"also known as ""safety signals."" If a safety signal is found in VAERS, further studies can be done in safety systems such as"
"the CDC's Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) or the Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) project. These systems do not have"
"the same limitations as VAERS, and can better assess health risks and possible connections between adverse events and a vaccine."
"</p> <p> Key considerations and limitations of VAERS data: <ul><li> Vaccine providers are encouraged to report any clinically"
"significant health problem following vaccination to VAERS, whether or not they believe the vaccine was the cause. </li><li>"
"Reports may include incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental and unverified information. </li><li> The number of reports alone"
"cannot be interpreted or used to reach conclusions about the existence, severity, frequency, or rates of problems associated"
"with vaccines. </li><li> VAERS data are limited to vaccine adverse event reports received between 1990 and the most recent date"
"for which data are available. </li><li> VAERS data do not represent all known safety information for a vaccine and should be"
"interpreted in the context of other scientific information. </li></ul> </p>"
"2."
"3. Some items may have more than 1 occurrence in any single event report, such as Symptoms, Vaccine Products, Manufacturers, and"
"Event Categories. If data are grouped by any of these items, then the number in the Events Reported column may exceed the total"
"number of unique events. If percentages are shown, then the associated percentage of total unique event reports will exceed 100%"
"in such cases. For example, the number of Symptoms mentioned is likely to exceed the number of events reported, because many"
"reports include more than 1 Symptom. When more than 1 Symptom occurs in a single report, then the percentage of Symptoms to"
"unique events is more than 100%. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/vaers.html#Suppress."
"4. Data contains VAERS reports processed as of 09/10/2021. The VAERS data in WONDER are updated weekly, yet the VAERS system"
"receives continuous updates including revisions and new reports for preceding time periods. Duplicate event reports and/or"
"reports determined to be false are removed from VAERS. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/vaers.html#Reporting."
"5. Values of Event Category field vary in their availability over time due to changes in the reporting form. The ""Emergency"
"Room/Office Visit"" value was avaliable only for events reported using the VAERS-1 form, active 07/01/1990 to 06/29/2017. The"
"""Congenital Anomaly/Birth Defect"", ""Emergency Room"", and ""Office Visit"" values are available only for events reported"
"using the VAERS 2.0 form, active 06/30/2017 to present. These changes must be considered when evaluating count of events for"
"these categories."
"6. About COVID19 vaccines: <UL><LI> For more information on how many persons have been vaccinated in the US for COVID19 to date,"
"see https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations/: <a target= .. </LI><LI> One report may state that the patient"
"received more than one brand of COVID-19 vaccine on the same visit. This is a reporting error, but explains why the total number"
"of reports may not equal the total number of COVID-19 vaccine doses. </LI></UL>"
