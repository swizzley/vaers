Has a history of attempted overdose in the past,, she was found down by her husband at 545, and unresponsive on scene.  Medic was on scene and patient was noted to be in V. fib and therefore CPR was started, compressions were in progress upon arrival, however the patient remained in cardiac arrest.  Other history was able to be gathered from the patient or family, however EMS stated that they had found that her glucose was 99 on scene, and she been given full dose Narcan as well on scene.  And was shocked 3 times a 200 J, she was given 2 doses of epinephrine, as well as 300 of amiodarone.  They attempted to intubate the patient however the patient was clamped down, and therefore they could not pass any sort of apparatus to control the airway, therefore they placed a nasal trumpet. Pertinent physical exam findings: Jaw clamped shut, pupils fixed, and was obviously cyanotic, no palpable pulses.  No chest rise. EKG as interpreted by me (ED attending): Monitor showed that the patient was in asystole the entire time. Medical Decision making and plan of care: Patient was immediately moved from gurney onto bed, and chest compressions were continued without interruption.  Given that the patient was in V. fib in the field, we did decide to place dual pads for dual sequential defibrillation, is on the plats however, the patient was noted to be in asystole, therefore chest compressions were continued, epinephrine, as well as calcium, as well as bicarb. See code chart for further details. IO was also placed in the patient's left proximal tibia.  Regarding the patient's airway, several attempts were made to pass an ET tube, as well as paralyzed the patient with rocuronium, however tube passing was unsuccessful, and therefore I performed a cricothyrotomy.  Followed by bilateral finger thoracostomies.  See procedure notes below for further details.   Despite 5 rounds of ACLS, with multiple doses of epinephrine, as well as bicarb and calcium carbonate administered, the patient remained in cardiac arrest, death was declared at 1851.""""

I had been breastfeeding my 6 week old baby at the time that I received the first Pfizer vaccine on June 4, 2021.  He became very sick with a high fever about 2 weeks after I got the first Pfizer vaccine on June 21. He was treated for 2 weeks with IV antibiotics for a supposed bacterial infection. However, they never found any specific bacteria, and called his diagnosis culture-negative sepsis. At the end of his hospital stay he tested positive for rhinovirus. After the 14 day course of antibiotics, he was home for one week, but exhibited strange symptoms (e.g. swollen eyelid, strange rashes, vomiting). I took him back to the hospital on July 15, where he presented with what they called an atypical Kawasaki disease. He passed away shortly thereafter from clots in his severely inflamed arteries. I am curious if the spike protein could have gone through the breast milk and caused an inflammatory response in my child. They say Kawasaki disease presents very similarly to the Multi-System Inflammatory Syndrome in children that they are seeing in post Covid infections.   (My baby also had unusual birth circumstances, as he was born at 37 weeks, triggered by a maternal appendicitis.) However, if they know that antibodies go through the breastmilk as a good thing, then why wouldn't the spike protein also go through the breastmilk and potentially cause problems."

The pain made its way up her leg and after 3 phone calls to 911over the course of 6 days she finally agreed to go to the hospital. These severe leg spasms would last for 3 hours and she had them about 4 times a day. She would state her pain level was a 20. She was admitted to the hospital and the Drs said due to the severe pain her BP was highly elevated and she was in congestive heart failure. She spent 2 weeks in the hospital. Went into A-fib. The spasms stopped exactly 2 weeks after they started but at that point she was so weak from being in bed that they wanted to discharge her to a rehab facility but she would have needed her second vaccine and it wasnt time yet( plus she refused because all her issues seemed to stem from the first vaccine). Or she would have to be in complete quarantine for 14 days and she was hard od hearing and that would not have been good either. So we brought her home for myseld and my sister to care for her. She was independent before this vaccine and needed complete care when she got home. She was home for 6 days and progressivly got worse each day and we had to put her on hospice on the 6 day and she passed that night."

A 72-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date in 2021 as dose 2, single for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included the patient was diabetic and had heart surgery. The patient's concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 for COVID-19 immunization in Apr2021. The reporter stated she needed help and the patient (her sister) passed away in Jul2021 and she had the cards that Pfizer got proving and had gotten the shot and they need to find out and get copies of the proof that they all received the Pfizer COVID vaccine. The reporter stated this is the card that Pfizer get signed and they need another copy. The reporter stated the family had been going through her sisters drawers and they can't find it and they were in her wallet but they were not there either. The reporter stated she didn't really need her sisters since she was dead but she needed her sisters daughter withheld and her husband withheld proof that they have been vaccinated and they received the first and second dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine. The reporter stated her sister did not die right after her first treatment which was in Apr2021 and she just passed away in Jul2021. The reporter stated she knew for a fact that it was not related to the vaccine and did not see the need to be transferred. The patient died in Jul2021.  It was not reported if an autopsy was performed.

Messages:
"1. The full results are too long to be displayed, only non-zero rows are available."
"2. VAERS data in CDC WONDER are updated every Friday. Hence, results for the same query can change from week to week."
"3. These results are for 305 total events."
"4. When grouped by VAERS ID, results initially don't show Events Reported, Percent, or totals. Use Quick or More Options to"
"restore them, if you wish."
"5. Click on a VAERS ID to see a report containing detailed information for the event."
"---"
Footnotes:
"1. Submitting a report to VAERS does not mean that healthcare personnel or the vaccine caused or contributed to the adverse"
"event (possible side effect)."
"---"
Caveats:
"1. <p> VAERS accepts reports of adverse events and reactions that occur following vaccination. Healthcare providers, vaccine"
"manufacturers, and the public can submit reports to VAERS. While very important in monitoring vaccine safety, VAERS reports"
"alone cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness. The reports may contain"
"information that is incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental, or unverifiable. Most reports to VAERS are voluntary, which means they"
"are subject to biases. This creates specific limitations on how the data can be used scientifically. Data from VAERS reports"
"should always be interpreted with these limitations in mind. </p> <p> The strengths of VAERS are that it is national in scope"
"and can quickly provide an early warning of a safety problem with a vaccine. As part of CDC and FDA's multi-system approach to"
"post-licensure vaccine safety monitoring, VAERS is designed to rapidly detect unusual or unexpected patterns of adverse events,"
"also known as ""safety signals."" If a safety signal is found in VAERS, further studies can be done in safety systems such as"
"the CDC's Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) or the Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) project. These systems do not have"
"the same limitations as VAERS, and can better assess health risks and possible connections between adverse events and a vaccine."
"</p> <p> Key considerations and limitations of VAERS data: <ul><li> Vaccine providers are encouraged to report any clinically"
"significant health problem following vaccination to VAERS, whether or not they believe the vaccine was the cause. </li><li>"
"Reports may include incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental and unverified information. </li><li> The number of reports alone"
"cannot be interpreted or used to reach conclusions about the existence, severity, frequency, or rates of problems associated"
"with vaccines. </li><li> VAERS data are limited to vaccine adverse event reports received between 1990 and the most recent date"
"for which data are available. </li><li> VAERS data do not represent all known safety information for a vaccine and should be"
"interpreted in the context of other scientific information. </li></ul> </p>"
"2."
"3. Some items may have more than 1 occurrence in any single event report, such as Symptoms, Vaccine Products, Manufacturers, and"
"Event Categories. If data are grouped by any of these items, then the number in the Events Reported column may exceed the total"
"number of unique events. If percentages are shown, then the associated percentage of total unique event reports will exceed 100%"
"in such cases. For example, the number of Symptoms mentioned is likely to exceed the number of events reported, because many"
"reports include more than 1 Symptom. When more than 1 Symptom occurs in a single report, then the percentage of Symptoms to"
"unique events is more than 100%. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/vaers.html#Suppress."
"4. Data contains VAERS reports processed as of 09/10/2021. The VAERS data in WONDER are updated weekly, yet the VAERS system"
"receives continuous updates including revisions and new reports for preceding time periods. Duplicate event reports and/or"
"reports determined to be false are removed from VAERS. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/vaers.html#Reporting."
"5. Values of Event Category field vary in their availability over time due to changes in the reporting form. The ""Emergency"
"Room/Office Visit"" value was avaliable only for events reported using the VAERS-1 form, active 07/01/1990 to 06/29/2017. The"
"""Congenital Anomaly/Birth Defect"", ""Emergency Room"", and ""Office Visit"" values are available only for events reported"
"using the VAERS 2.0 form, active 06/30/2017 to present. These changes must be considered when evaluating count of events for"
"these categories."
"6. About COVID19 vaccines: <UL><LI> For more information on how many persons have been vaccinated in the US for COVID19 to date,"
"see https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations/: <a target= .. </LI><LI> One report may state that the patient"
"received more than one brand of COVID-19 vaccine on the same visit. This is a reporting error, but explains why the total number"
"of reports may not equal the total number of COVID-19 vaccine doses. </LI></UL>"
