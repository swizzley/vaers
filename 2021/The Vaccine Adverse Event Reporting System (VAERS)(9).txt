Deceased 2. Perforated Gastric Ulcer 3. Acute Blood loss anemia 4. COVID19 5. AKI with CKD stage III 6. Acute Metabolic Encephalopathy       DETAILS OF HOSPITAL STAY: PRESENTING PROBLEM: Respiratory distress   HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was a 94-year-old male who was initially hospitalized with signs of septic shock believed to be secondary to COVID-19 and possible bacterial pneumonia; as well as new onset AFib with RVR.  Patient was admitted to the intensive care unit, he did have improvement initially with fluid resuscitation and Levophed as well as amiodarone infusion.  Further workup did reveal a pneumoperitoneum patient desired aggressive treatment and went forward knowing high risk of death with exploratory laparotomy.  This was done on 08/22/2021 and patient was found to have a pre pyloric perforation and peritonitis.  Patient was returned back to the intensive care unit and remained intubated along with central line placements.  Aggressive treatment continued, patient was extubated on 8/25 but not responding; further findings on repeat CT scans on 08/25 showed continued leaking from stomach as well as findings of a potential cancerous brain mass.  On 08/26/21 family, along with son, mutually agreed on comfort care initiation. Today at 0300 patient passed away, attempted son x3 calls, but then did get through to other son who was to notify the family.   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 94-year-old man with a past medical history significant for CVA and mild dementia, CKD stage 3, hypertension and hypothyroidism who was admitted to intensive care unit on August 22, 2021 for COVID-19 infection and septic shock.   The patient was recently hospitalized from April 11th through April 15th for physical deconditioning.  During that time he was diagnosed with dementia with a MoCAa score of 6/30.  He discharged to Rehab where he has been continued undergo rehabilitation.  Today he presented to the emergency department in extremis.  He was in profound respiratory distress and shock.  He tested positive for COVID at his care facility a couple days prior.  This unclear if he had been undergoing any kind of treatment for this.  He had significant episodes of nonresponsiveness an apnea while in the ED.  Additionally, he was profoundly hypotensive and tachycardia with new onset rapid atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response.  He was hypothermic and placed on a Bair Hugger.  Initial blood work revealed mild electrolyte abnormalities, lactic acid greater than 7, a creatinine of 1.9.  Chest x-ray revealed mild scattered interstitial thickening and lung opacities.  Patient was started on IV fluid and placed on phenylephrine infusion.  Conversation with the patient's son, as well as his other son reveal that the patient would not want CPR or to be placed on a ventilator but they would want to pursue all other aggressive measures.  He was then transitioned up to the emergency department to the intensive care unit for further management.   Intensive care unit course: After arrival to the intensive care unit the patient was aggressively fluid resuscitated.  His blood pressures responded relatively well.  Due to pharmacy shortage of the phenylephrine the patient was transitioned to norepinephrine.  His cognitive status drastically improved from when I evaluated him in the emergency department.  He is alert and oriented x3.  Suspicious for ongoing COVID infection and possible pneumonia the patient's antibiotics were transitioned to cefepime plus azithromycin plus vancomycin.  He is started on remdesivir for COVID 19 treatment.  ABG revealed compensated metabolic acidosis.  The patient's lactic acid has improved to 6.5 from 7. Initial troponins are elevated as expected from demand ischemia from septic shock.  EKG does not reveal any ST segment changes in the patient does not complain of any chest pain.  He is, however complaining of abdominal pain.  He has a soft right inguinal hernia which is difficult to reduce and has no overlying skin changes.  The patient has had increasing oxygen needs initially requiring 6 L of oxygen in the emergency department now on 100% oxygen via non-rebreather.   At approximately 1630 while I was re-evaluating the patient and discussing his care to son the patient entered into a what appeared to be wide complex ventricular tachycardia with an initial heart rate of approximately 240. Nurse was in the room with me.  The patient was not feeling well.  His Levophed was shut off and fluids were started.  A stat amiodarone infusion of 150 mg was begun.  Patient was connected to defibrillator pads.  Asked the patient and family if he required cardiac defibrillation if he would want that, and he very explicitly said ""yes!"".  His heart rate responded to the amiodarone infusion, however, and he subsequently entered into what appeared to be a narrow complex supraventricular tachycardia with a heart rate of approximately 180. His blood pressure remained stable during this time.  As we continued to monitor in supportive care and continued his amiodarone infusion the patient's heart rate then entered into a normal sinus rhythm with a systolic rate of approximately 90. Unfortunately, strips of these rhythms were unable to be captured.  EKG afterwards revealed normal sinus rhythm with a first-degree heart block and previously seen right bundle-branch block.  After his amiodarone infusion I did not bolus further or start continued infusion for the patient but plan to continue monitoring.     Stat CT of chest abdomen and pelvis was obtained.  This revealed many things but specifically a pneumoperitoneum.  The case was discussed with the on-call general surgeon who evaluated the patient with me in the intensive care unit.  Along with the patient's son and other son, it was decided the patient would want to pursue aggressive measures including exploratory laparotomy.  Risks of surgery including death were shared with the patient.  Furthermore was explicitly stated that he would likely return to the intensive care unit ventilator dependent with multiple drains and need for central line and continued resuscitation the ultimate outcome of which being still high likelihood of death.  Understanding this the patient and his son still wanted to proceed.  Alternatives, including comfort care were offered and declined.

EMS reported that initial sats were 50% she was placed on a non-rebreather mask.  She subsequently was placed on BiPAP in the emergency room and her saturations actually decreased therefore she was placed back on a non-rebreather mask.  The patient continued to decline and ultimately required intubation after her initial blood gas revealed her to be extremely acidotic with a pH is 7.19 and pCO2 of 83.  Little is known about the patient's history otherwise I do not know if she has had any fever.  I have been told that the patient has been fully vaccinated for COVID.  She has had a COVID swab returned as positive tonight.  I am unaware of  exposures at this time.  She has other remarkable findings in the emergency room specifically a leukocytosis of 34,000 with left shift.  ProBNP is 11000.  Procalcitonin is elevated at 1.18.  The patient has a history of incarcerated diaphragmatic hernia in 2014.  On chest x-ray tonight it appears that she has stomach in her chest.  On the CT it also appears that she has hiatal hernia with part of the stomach in the chest also part of the colon in the chest through her diaphragmatic hernia.  Question of bowel obstruction is raised but no definitive answer is given on CT.  Patient also has a consolidation of the right upper lobe with possible mass.  CT also reveals bilateral findings consistent with COVID.  No PE.  The patient I believe has a cardiac history and has a history of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.    DISCHARGE: Patient was a 74-year-old patient, who was admitted after arriving via EMS with respiratory distress.  Apparently, she had been sick for 2 weeks for shortness of breath.  She came to the ER, was emergently intubated with acute hypoxic hypercapnic respiratory failure.  The patient has multiple CTs done, one of the chest revealed a central mass with significant narrowing of the right upper lobe and right middle lobe pulmonary arteries, stenosis of the right upper lobe bronchus.  I thought she probably had a postobstructive pneumonia.  Also, of note, she has some patchy airspace disease, consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia.  The patient did test positive for COVID-19.  The patient was intubated, placed in ICU. Palliative Care was consulted and after discussion with family, it was decided to remove her from the ventilator given her diagnoses.  The patient was extubated and pronounced by Dr. at 05:39 p.m."	"Coronavirus test: 08/19/2021 = positive"	"No current illness for this event."	"No prior vaccinations for this event."

On presentation to the ED the Pt stated on 07/24 he began to have subjective fevers, weakness and fatigue, and with reported syncopal events. Patient was treated with dexamethasone 6 mg daily, remdesivir, and tocilizumab.     On 8/6 the patient had worsening shortness of breath with increasing oxygen requirements.  On 8/7, the patient had worsening respiratory distress and increasing oxygen requirements 100% & 70L HFNC as well as 100% non-rebreather with persistent hypoxia ultimately requiring intubation. Furthermore, a dialysis catheter was placed and CRRT was initiated. Broad spectrum ABX were continued. On 8/8, he required addition of NMB for continued ventilator dys-synchrony. He completed the dex-ARDS protocol on 8/10. The patient had a decline on 8/11 with a fever, worsening shock. He was started back on broad spectrum antibiotics, vasopressin in addition to levophed, and stress dose steroids. Unfortunately, Pt remained with persistent and profound hemodynamic instability. His response to aggressive live saving measures was minimal. WBC up to 80 with no infectious source able to be identified, escalation of ABX still continued. CT scans unable to be obtained secondary to risk of fatal event occurring if moved and/or transported to scanner. On 8/13, Pt going into arrythmias which further exacerbated further instability, required cardioversions X 3 and antiarrhythmic medications. Goals of care discussions completed with wife. Despite attempting to give Pt more time to possibly respond to treatments, his status remained critical. Wife came to see her husband at bedside to be with him briefly before he passed away.

On 24Aug2021, the patient received a booster dose and went home first. No one lives with her and she lives alone. The reporter's brother went to see her, and she was almost at her death. He called 911 and they took her to the hospital, and she died on 25Aug2021. An autopsy was not performed. The reporter wanted to know why did this happen to her and what caused her death and what happened to her. She was just trying to help the public after this happened. Doctors should be informed and the public needs to be informed on when to take the shot and when not to take the shot. She doesn't have all that information on when the patient received the first and second dose and just know that patient took it at the doctor's office, she went home, and she died after getting the vaccine. The caller asked if adverse reaction/experience may be related to the product or not and response was provided that Pfizer cannot assess causality and doctor/healthcare provider is in the best position to assess and advise as your doctor/healthcare provider was most familiar with your medical condition, clinical history, how your treatment has been conducted and any relevant information to your specific case. And also informed that Pfizer was unable to make recommendations or diagnoses on a case-by-case basis for individual patients. It was the healthcare professional's discretion with their use of clinical judgment to determine the safety of their patients. The caller was offered to provide CICP information and offered to provide Pfizer legal teams address and fax number. The reported that it was her sister in law so she doesn't have all the information, she doesn't have the doctors name or what was going on with her. She doesn't know a lot of information to give at this time. She said there was type of website to get some compensation. Do they reimbursement right after or when? She talked to someone in VAERS. She really doesn't know what to report, or why or what happened. She doesn't know if it was a blood clot or what. The doctor just gave her the shot. Maybe the patient needed the booster because her immune system was not up to par. She would like to know more information from the doctor. The caller asked who is capable of getting the booster shot? Is it just people that are immunocompromised or is it specific ages like people above 65 years old? The caller asked if people taking certain medications that don't allow the vaccine to work properly would be included in this group or not. The caller stated the way they have it on TV and everywhere she was thinking that everyone is able to get a booster. She stated the understanding is that certain ages over 65 can get it. (documenting as potential Pfizer complaint because she was commenting on how the guidance is not clear). The caller asked how long it will take to get the email from, agent (she just spoke with her prior to getting transferred. She stated everything is important in regard to timing, this needs to be handled quickly. She was not sure if Pfizer would want an autopsy, but they cannot afford it. She had spoken with (withheld) about wanting compensation and (withheld) was going to send an email because she asked for this in writing and not verbally. She stated she could take this information verbally now.

DETAILS OF HOSPITAL STAY: PRESENTING PROBLEM: Cellulitis of left leg [L03.116] Cellulitis [L03.90] Cellulitis of left lower extremity [L03.116] HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient is a 66-year-old female with past medical history significant for multiple medical comorbidities including severe peripheral arterial disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary hypertension, history of TAVR, history of TIA, morbid obesity, OSA/CPAP, diabetes on insulin, CKD 3B, chronic diastolic heart failure, peripheral edema, chronic pain, ongoing tobacco abuse recent fall resulting in a right fibular fracture presents to hospital on 08/23 from subacute rehab facility due to worsening lower extremity pain, lethargy, chills, decreased oral intake for about 5 days prior to presentation and was incidentally noted to be COVID positive.  Patient also recently had a hospital stay from 07/28 to 8/3 due to a right fibular fracture and was fitted with a cam boot with instructions to weight bear as tolerated.  Patient was admitted with working diagnosis of acute encephalopathy and lower extremity cellulitis on the left and asymptomatic COVID-19 infection. Encephalopathy:  Felt to be related to polypharmacy including sedating medications namely gabapentin, Norco and possibly also related to infection.  VBG with CO2 of only 44. With supportive treatment alone, her encephalopathy improved over the next 24-48 hours and resolved completely.  Only Norco was restarted.  Gabapentin was planned to be discontinued due to ineffectiveness. Cellulitis:  Patient was noted to have left leg cellulitis associated with changes consistent with venous stasis and edema.  Patient was started on Ancef initially but surface cultures obtained at the time of admit showed MRSA and hence vancomycin was added on top.  Ancef was discontinued on 08/24 with plans to continue vancomycin and eventually switch over to doxycycline to completed 10 day course.  Cellulitis gradually was improving; COVID-19 infection:  Incidentally noted at rehab on 08/22,  patient without much respiratory symptoms and continued on 3 L baseline oxygen and hence no particular treatment was initiated. Right fibular fracture: due to previous fall/recent hospital stay at which time orthopedics recommended non operative management with a Cam boot and weight-bearing as tolerated.  Patient had not had a chance to follow-up with orthopedics and hence consult was obtained here.  Repeat x-ray showed improvement and possible healing, Orthopedics recommended continuation of Cam boot with weight-bearing as tolerated in outpatient follow-up. Peripheral arterial disease:  With extensive nature of peripheral arterial disease noted on previous imaging studies with plans for following up with vascular surgery at Metro Hospital with upcoming plans for angiography/angioplasty.  There was no concern for acute ischemia on exam. Anasarca, acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure with significant weight gain compared to previous hospital stay.  Daughter did mention that subacute rehab did not really pay close attention to her salt intake and weight gain and she had gained significant amount await (close to 20 kilos) and hence aggressive IV  Lasix/diureses were started.  Her renal function mostly was holding in spite of aggressive diureses and slow weight loss.  This was also noted in the lower extremities with improvement in the edema. On 08/28,  during my interview patient had a unremarkable night, used her BiPAP in the night, noticed that she was slightly more short of breath ( while she had taken off her CPAP mask, had not put her oxygen on yet), a short while later when she was helped to the bedside commode for urination, patient became acutely short of breath, appeared  unwell and lost her pulse is.  All code was called and resuscitation efforts were continued for 29 minutes and and unsuccessful in obtaining ROSC, pronounced at 11:35 a.m..  Suspicion was that she may have had a PE or seizure (she did have seizures during resuscitation). Daughter was notified, discussed with a little bit later when she arrived at bedside.

"1. The full results are too long to be displayed, only non-zero rows are available."
"2. VAERS data in CDC WONDER are updated every Friday. Hence, results for the same query can change from week to week."
"3. These results are for 441 total events."
"4. When grouped by VAERS ID, results initially don't show Events Reported, Percent, or totals. Use Quick or More Options to"
"restore them, if you wish."
"5. Click on a VAERS ID to see a report containing detailed information for the event."
"---"
Footnotes:
"1. Submitting a report to VAERS does not mean that healthcare personnel or the vaccine caused or contributed to the adverse"
"event (possible side effect)."
"---"
Caveats:
"1. <p> VAERS accepts reports of adverse events and reactions that occur following vaccination. Healthcare providers, vaccine"
"manufacturers, and the public can submit reports to VAERS. While very important in monitoring vaccine safety, VAERS reports"
"alone cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness. The reports may contain"
"information that is incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental, or unverifiable. Most reports to VAERS are voluntary, which means they"
"are subject to biases. This creates specific limitations on how the data can be used scientifically. Data from VAERS reports"
"should always be interpreted with these limitations in mind. </p> <p> The strengths of VAERS are that it is national in scope"
"and can quickly provide an early warning of a safety problem with a vaccine. As part of CDC and FDA's multi-system approach to"
"post-licensure vaccine safety monitoring, VAERS is designed to rapidly detect unusual or unexpected patterns of adverse events,"
"also known as ""safety signals."" If a safety signal is found in VAERS, further studies can be done in safety systems such as"
"the CDC's Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) or the Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) project. These systems do not have"
"the same limitations as VAERS, and can better assess health risks and possible connections between adverse events and a vaccine."
"</p> <p> Key considerations and limitations of VAERS data: <ul><li> Vaccine providers are encouraged to report any clinically"
"significant health problem following vaccination to VAERS, whether or not they believe the vaccine was the cause. </li><li>"
"Reports may include incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental and unverified information. </li><li> The number of reports alone"
"cannot be interpreted or used to reach conclusions about the existence, severity, frequency, or rates of problems associated"
"with vaccines. </li><li> VAERS data are limited to vaccine adverse event reports received between 1990 and the most recent date"
"for which data are available. </li><li> VAERS data do not represent all known safety information for a vaccine and should be"
"interpreted in the context of other scientific information. </li></ul> </p>"
"2."
"3. Some items may have more than 1 occurrence in any single event report, such as Symptoms, Vaccine Products, Manufacturers, and"
"Event Categories. If data are grouped by any of these items, then the number in the Events Reported column may exceed the total"
"number of unique events. If percentages are shown, then the associated percentage of total unique event reports will exceed 100%"
"in such cases. For example, the number of Symptoms mentioned is likely to exceed the number of events reported, because many"
"reports include more than 1 Symptom. When more than 1 Symptom occurs in a single report, then the percentage of Symptoms to"
"unique events is more than 100%. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/vaers.html#Suppress."
"4. Data contains VAERS reports processed as of 09/10/2021. The VAERS data in WONDER are updated weekly, yet the VAERS system"
"receives continuous updates including revisions and new reports for preceding time periods. Duplicate event reports and/or"
"reports determined to be false are removed from VAERS. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/vaers.html#Reporting."
"5. Values of Event Category field vary in their availability over time due to changes in the reporting form. The ""Emergency"
"Room/Office Visit"" value was avaliable only for events reported using the VAERS-1 form, active 07/01/1990 to 06/29/2017. The"
"""Congenital Anomaly/Birth Defect"", ""Emergency Room"", and ""Office Visit"" values are available only for events reported"
"using the VAERS 2.0 form, active 06/30/2017 to present. These changes must be considered when evaluating count of events for"
"these categories."
"6. About COVID19 vaccines: <UL><LI> For more information on how many persons have been vaccinated in the US for COVID19 to date,"
"see https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations/: <a target= .. </LI><LI> One report may state that the patient"
"received more than one brand of COVID-19 vaccine on the same visit. This is a reporting error, but explains why the total number"
"of reports may not equal the total number of COVID-19 vaccine doses. </LI></UL>"
