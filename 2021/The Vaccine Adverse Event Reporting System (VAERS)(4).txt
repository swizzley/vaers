On Sunday, March 21st, 911 had to be called as his seizure did not end.  He had a grand male.  He was seizing for several hours.  At the time this was all occurring he has been on anti seizure meds for a few years Divalproex 1000 mg am and 1000 mgs pm daily).  He passed 1 week later, March 28 at approx 6:45pm at the Clinic.  I am unable to get any information  on his medical report for that week.  Statement from his Nurologists is on second page. Additional information for Item 18:   Statement:  47 year old gentleman who passed away on March 28 from aspiration pneumonia secondary to status epilepticus and on a history of multiple sclerosis / additional leukoencephalopathy of unknown etiology (both treated with rituximab), prior seizures (on valproic acid) and pulmonary embolism (on apixaban). The key reason for reaching out is in light of the announcement about the side effects of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine specifically cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. While he had a known history of seizures, he had no clear trigger for these seizures; including that his valproic acid level was therapeutic (83.0 mcg/mL) at time of presentation. He had, however, received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine on March 12 before having what in hindsight appeared to be repeated seizures between March 18-21; he had a more significant one on March 21 that hospitalized him. This time frame appears consistent with the reported cases of central venous sinus thrombosis associated with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Equally, he was taking apixaban at that point in time and his PLT (173) / INR (1.1) / PTT (36.6) at time of presentation were all normal and stable. He did have an elevated ProBNP (552.0) at presentation; nasopharyngeal swab was negative for COVID / Influenza A/B / RSV and non-contrast head CT did not show any clear new abnormalities. His only D-dimer was obtained on March 23 and was 226. He did not have a CT angiogram or venogram.   Overall the link between the vaccine and pt. seizures is not definite. At the same time, the similarity with the reported cases has led to me wanting to report it in case of the possible link.

He was in his usual state if health until Sunday. On Saturday he got COVID vaccine at 4pm, that evening he had no issues. Sunday night around 10pm he didn't make complete sense and his wife was concerned because of his history of DM and treated CNS lymphoma. BG was 320-340 at that time. Monday he was good and Monday night he started to have shaking of his left hand. Tuesday he had one episode of diarrhea. Later he was more shaky in the shower and he started to fall and his wife was unable to grab him and he slid down the wall and could not get up.  Family was called to help and he was not making sense so they called EMS.  Wife reports that he was down approximately 3 hours before EMS was able to get him up. In EMS he was noted to have a large area of skin desquamation from the right posterior knee to the ankle. His GCS was 15. He had stable blood pressure and heart rate. He was hypoxia to the 50s and oxygen was applied.   In the ED he was found to be in multisystem organ failure and was intubated and had rapid progression of shock requiring  Epinephrine, Levophed and Vasopressin. Crash lines were placed and he was sent to hospital.  Upon arrival he was noted to have a cold pulseless right lower extremity and surgery was called. He was evaluated by Trauma Surgery, Orthopedic surgery and Vascular surgery and eventually underwent above the knee amputation. Unfortunately they were not able to remove all nonviable tissue and he continued to deteriorate. He was taken level 1 back to the OR and an additional 10 cm of nonviable tissue was removed. Unfortunately upon arrive he suffered cardiac arrest in the setting of severe lactic acidosis and hyperkalemia."	"No lab data for this event."

Cath lab was notified and she was taken emergently to the cath lab with ongoing mechanical device CPR.  Peripheral VA ECMO was placed after about 1.5 hours.  Pulmonary angiogram was done which showed massive saddle PE with near complete obliteration of the right pulmonary tree and some filling defects in the left tree as well.  At that time she had severe mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis with a lactate of 24.  She also had no gag or corneal reflex, minimally responsive pupils, and no response to noxious stimuli.

Went to heart doctor out of precaution, full work up...everything checked out great.  Went home, got no better.  Went to primary care physician, full work up...found a ""spot"" on left lung.  Was given antibiotics and steroids, go home and in a few days will be getting better.  3 days later became incapacitated and had to be rushed to ER.  Was admitted into hospital for 6 days to treat ""pneumonia"".  Also possible UTI and sepsis.  Also while in hospital found out that a mini stroke had happened.  Treatment went well, oxygen levels were good.  Was released with glowing reports.  24 hours later at home had to be rushed to ER again after becoming incapacitated..  Was admitted again  7 more days.  During this time everything took a nose dive in succession.  Lungs were failing, multiple unexplained strokes were happening (while on blood thinners, had been on blood thinner 15 years...after first stroke they changed to another blood thinner...only more strokes).  After so many strokes and compounding of strokes, his neuro function started failing.  He was put on life support.  While on life support his organs started failing.  He had to be put on comfort mode and was dead within 8 hours.

I took him into the VA to get his second covid vaccine on 2/17/21.   At that time my grandp lived semi-independently in a house between my parents and my uncle .  He didn't get out very much but with some help of grocery shopping and organizing his medication he was still able to live alone and function well independently.  My mother reported to me on 2/18/21 that my grandpa was confused, weak and tired.  My grandpa has never had any signs of dementia.  At this time he developed a delerium that waxed and waned.  He complained of headache, no appetite and extreme weakness.  On 2/23/21 he fell down in his house and we decided to move him into my uncles spare bedroom to keep better eyes on him.  The delerium persisted and on 3/5 he was taken to Hospital for a workup for his delerium and weakness.  There he saw Dr. an internal medicine doctor at hospital.  The workup showed an elevated BNP (probably baseline but I'd have to look at previous lab results) but nothing further.  We opted not to do further imaging and instead take him home.  It became obvious to me that this was the end of his life and so I requested a hospice referral from Dr. My grandpa died on 3/24/21."	"No lab data for this event."

A 71-year-old male patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EL9264) on 10Feb2021 at about 19:00 (at the age of 71 years), in left deltoid, for COVID-19 immunisation. No other vaccines were given on the same day or within 4 weeks. The patient declined flu vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine (PNEUMOVAX), he had never had another vaccine except maybe his childhood vaccines. Medical history included rotator cuff surgery and cataract removed in 2020. The patient exercised regularly, he was healthy, he walked for miles and didn't eat any non-sense, he did not eat out, he did not smoke. The patient's mother was 100 years old and fully competent. The patient had two sisters older than him, the oldest one had hypertension the second sister did not have anything that they were aware of. The patient's father lived until he was 98 years old. The patient concomitant medications were none. The patient was told to take vitamin D 50,000 units but didn't even take them (he still had 9 of them in the bottle and they gave him 13). The patient experienced fever on 11Feb2021, renal failure on 14Feb2021, pulmonary embolus on 28Feb2021, cardiac arrest on 04Mar2021, dehydration and not eating or drinking on an unspecified date in Feb2021. These events required ER visit and were reported as serious as involved hospitalization from 14Feb2021 to 04Mar2021 and as fatal events. The patient died on 04Mar2021. Clinical course of the events included the following information. The patient received the first vaccine on 10Feb2021, the next day he developed a fever. The reporter spoke with the patient's doctor who told to give the patient paracetamol (TYLENOL) thinking the fever was from the vaccine. On 12Feb2021 and 13Feb2021, the patient's temperature was 102. Then the doctor advised to take the patient to the hospital. The patient's temperature was still 102, he was in renal failure, and they had to dialyze him. The patient was otherwise healthy, the patient's last physical was in Dec2020 and the only thing it showed was that his A1C was 5.7. The patient had no cholesterol or hypertension. The doctor advised the patient to decrease sugar and carbs because the holidays were coming up. The patient's follow up was scheduled on Mar2021. The reporter felt that the vaccine has something to do with the patient renal failure. The reporter spoke with the doctors at the hospital who didn't want to commit to anything. The reporter believed this was an adverse event. The caller mentioned that she had her vaccine before and she was fine. The patient was admitted on 14Feb2021 and by Wednesday he was not eating or drinking, he was dehydrated. The patient's admitting diagnoses was elevated temperature and ruling out COVID. The patient tested positive for Covid on 14Feb2021 (COVID-19 PCR test). The patient's temperature was 99.8 and then kept creeping up, on Saturday it was 102. The caller gave the patient Tylenol cold and flu (lot T0CL001021, expiry date Oct2021) took the edge off but in three hours the temperature was back up again. The patient never complained of pain and didn't want to take Tylenol. On 15Feb2021 the patient's numbers were getting better after the fluid challenge and then his numbers kept creeping up after that. The patient had the fever a week until they had it under control. The fever went away, it was gone for like 5 days, then it spiked again. The patient was started on piperacillin/tazobactam (ZOSYN) for like 3 or 5 days and the fever went away but then it kept getting worse. On 28Feb2021, the medical personnel thought the patient had a pulmonary emboli but because of the renal failure, they couldn't do a computerized tomography on the patient. The doctors mentioned that the patient was in renal failure and they thought they heparinized the patient and he had a blood clot who led to pulmonary embolus, cardiac arrest, and death. The patient was diagnosed with a pulmonary emboli on 28Feb2021. The patient started de-saturating and the doctors intubated and sedated him that whole time until this. Dialysis was started on 01Mar2021 and the patient received it every day except 04Mar2021. The patient's blood pressure was normal, it hardly ever went above 120. The patient was on the medical floor from 22Feb2021 to 04Mar2021. When the patient was on the medical surgical floor, he was on high flow 5 liters. After the patient started desaturating, he went to the intensive care unit and was put on a non-rebreather on 45%. The patient's highest heart rate was after intubation was 135, but the patient's blood pressure was low so they started him on some vasopressors. They did the fluid challenge on the patient and his labs were a little better than the labs kept creeping up until the doctor inserted a shiley catheter for dialysis. Respiratory: Respiratory arrest and then cardiac arrest. Respiratory failure, they intubated the patient. The reporter assumed dyspnea because the patient was intubated. Tachypnea was when the patient was in the intensive care unit already intubated. Hypoxemia, they intubated the patient so the caller guessed it was for the oxygen saturation drop. Covid pneumonia: yes. Chest x-ray showed mild pneumonia. The caller requested a follow up x-ray and the doctors said they were going to do another one but the caller is unsure if they did or when. The patient received additional therapies for COVID-19: remdesivir. Other radiological investigations: unable because of the patient's kidney function. They were looking at the D dimer and BMP to come up with the embolus since the patient couldn't have the scan. ARDS: no. Cardiovascular: The patient had a heart attack on 04Mar2021. The reporter thought it was from the pulmonary embolus which led to cardiac arrest. Arrhythmia: the caller guessed so, the patient was being worked on for 10 minutes before the caller got there. The caller saw a rhythm strip which showed a flat line and then she noticed ventricular tachycardia, then a flat line. The patient did not have SARS-CoV2 antibodies at diagnosis. Gastrointestinal/Hepatic, neurological, hematological, dermatological: none. Vascular: pulmonary embolus: yes, deep vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, vasculitis: no. Renal: renal failure: yes, acute kidney injury: no. The patient was scheduled for his second vaccine dose on 03Mar2021 at 04:15 but did not receive it. Time of death was 4:15 in the afternoon on 04Mar2021. The reporter considered renal failure, fever, dehydration, not eating or drinking, cardiac arrest and pulmonary embolus as fatal and related to the suspect vaccine. The outcome of the other events was unknown. Cause of death was unknown. No autopsy was performed.; Sender's Comments: Based on current information available, the company considered there is a possibility that all reported events are consequence of COVID-19 pneumonia on the basis of advanced age. The positive COVID-19 test occurred 4 days after the first injection of suspect vaccine BNT162B2. No complete effect can be achieved for short time interval. The COVID-19 is more likely pre-existing colonization or intercurrent condition, unrelated to suspect vaccine BNT162b2.

She was alive and well and living independently at her home. She could walk, talk, make her own food, wash and dry her own clothes and take her own baths.   After taking the second vaccination she went down hill. She became sicker and sicker and eventually she started coughing up blood. She decided to go to the hospital, another Hospital of facility. I don't know what the treatment was at that hospital but she was soon transferred to facility and that is where I was notified she was in the hospital and visited her there. After arriving they intubated her and said she had blood clots in her brain and heart. When I saw her after she transferred from Hospital to the Hospital I noticed one arm was swollen. Her legs were as they have been for the last 20 years and looked okay to me--no discoloration other than her regular discoloring at one right ankle and the same old same old slight swelling in the left ankle. The doctors and nurses were putting the blame on her legs but you could tell things were happening else where.  But as she got worse and worse at the hospital her right arm become more and more swollen with dark bruises appearing--the hospital staff took pictures. The left arm continued to swell and did not look normal at all. She apparently had bleeding in her left lung from a blood clot. She had three areas of her brain that add clots and some bleeding. She was constipated and gaseous when they cleaned her. They didn't treat her constipation which made being intubated worse because I feel that caused her intestines to swell, thus she also had bleeding in her intestines.  My mother died on March 17, 2021 at hospital in ICU. I was told they could not treat the blood clots because of the bleeding in her lung, intestines and brain."	"I don't know what lab work they did. My brother who lives with her works in their lab at the location and may know. My other who is a pharmacist works in the hospital's location and was her proxy. The proxy refused to consider that her condition was due to the vaccine stating that February was too long ago for the two to be related. He was in denial. I feel the hospital staff was in denial. They wouldn't consider that the vaccine caused blood clots in my mom.  My mother died."	"No current illness for this event."	"No prior vaccinations for this event."

They drove up, they were ready to shoot us with the needle and they asked the patient, asked was he allergic to anything and the reporter answered for him and said yes, Penicillin and other long list and then they gave him the shot. They never did go over his allergies. They got home about 13:30, so which would take us about that long to get home.

On 2/12/21 I rushed him to the ER. He was vomiting uncontrollably and had shortness of breath. Once arrived at ER, they immediately put him on oxygen. Vomiting lasted several hours. They tested him for Covid and did a chest x-ray. Tested positive for Covid. Chest x-ray showed Covid pneumonia. Was admitted. Stayed in hospital for 5 days and was then released to nursing home for physical and occupational therapy. He was very weak and on days experienced what they called Covid fog. After 2 weeks of therapy, he was released on 03/06/21 to go back home to his apartment, with extended visiting nurse therapy. On 3/10/21, was the first visiting nurse appointment. At 12:00 an RN came to his apartment from  Home Health Care. She checked his vitals. She said his blood pressure was good, lungs sounded good and oxygen level was 98. She said he was doing good and that she would not need to continue to come out and check on him weekly. She left. At 2:30 the same day, a Physical Therapist from Home Health Care came. She asked him lots of questions and adjusted my fathers' walker for him. He showed her how he was doing using the walker. Walked approximately 15-20 feet in his apartment. She checked his vitals before she left. His oxygen level was now at 91. She had him take a few deep breathes until his oxygen level was up to 93. She left and said she would be back on Friday the 12th to begin the actual physical therapy then. Within 10 minutes after she left my father started shaking uncontrollably and was having difficulties breathing. I called 911. Paramedics arrived. My fathers' oxygen level was all the way down to 74. They took him to the ER. When getting him out of ambulance he began vomiting. Vomiting lasted for hours just like when he went to the hospital back in February. They tried 3 different drugs to control the nausea. They did EKG, chest and abdomen scans. Was found that he had multiple blood clots and inflammation in his lungs and a bacterial infection in his blood. After testing, bacteria was found to be E Coli. Treated him with heparin for clots and antibiotics for infection and had him on oxygen in nose. Every day thereafter, he felt worse. They switched him to a high flow oxygen mask to keep his oxygen levels up. By Saturday night (early morning Sunday) on 03/14, they had taken the high flow oxygen mask off and hooked him up to a BiPap oxygen machine because his oxygen levels were dropping too low. We were then told by the lung doctor, that the damage to his lungs was extreme and that the next step would be to put him on a ventilator and feeding tube. My father did not want this per his will and his discussion with Dr earlier in the week. Dr indicated that he would not get better just being on the BiPap machine and we then chose to have them take him off of the machine because he did not want to go on life support. My father passed away on Sunday, March 14th around 6:30pm."

This morning they had been reading on the news that the Johnson and Johnson vaccine is on hold. It seems to be put on the market without research. She felt like her father was a guinea pig. Her mother didn't want to get her second dose. Stated there seems to be an issue with Pfizer too. Her father had no issues whatsoever. His death certificate stated the cause of death was a pulmonary embolism, but he had no history of blood clots. Passed away Friday 26Mar2021 at 11:33 am. The reporter stated when he went to Emergency Room they thought he was having a heart attack. All physicians were wondering what happened because he had no health issues. The event required a visit to the emergency room that day because he passed out at his job. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included lab work: good in 2011.

Its unknown whether the vaccine contributed to the adverse outcome, but given that this person had the vaccine recently, it should have been investigated.

However on March 8 at 3pm, she felt light-headed but on her way back to her living room, her breathing was disrupted.  Her breaths were cut short and she was not receiving much air into her lungs.

She was transferred to another hospital later than night.  She was sent home for hospice (still unconscious) on March 16 or 17. She passed morning of March 19.  Death certificate states cause of death was lack of oxygen to the brain, but no determination was made to what caused her breathing problems, which caused the lack of oxygen to her brain.  EMT crew said her symptoms were very similar to blood clot in lungs. Hospital ruled out a blood clot.  They also downloaded data from the pacemaker and ruled out A-Fib as the cause.

"1. The full results are too long to be displayed, only non-zero rows are available."
"2. VAERS data in CDC WONDER are updated every Friday. Hence, results for the same query can change from week to week."
"3. These results are for 1,243 total events."
"4. When grouped by VAERS ID, results initially don't show Events Reported, Percent, or totals. Use Quick or More Options to"
"restore them, if you wish."
"5. Click on a VAERS ID to see a report containing detailed information for the event."
"---"
Footnotes:
"1. Submitting a report to VAERS does not mean that healthcare personnel or the vaccine caused or contributed to the adverse"
"event (possible side effect)."
"---"
Caveats:
"1. <p> VAERS accepts reports of adverse events and reactions that occur following vaccination. Healthcare providers, vaccine"
"manufacturers, and the public can submit reports to VAERS. While very important in monitoring vaccine safety, VAERS reports"
"alone cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness. The reports may contain"
"information that is incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental, or unverifiable. Most reports to VAERS are voluntary, which means they"
"are subject to biases. This creates specific limitations on how the data can be used scientifically. Data from VAERS reports"
"should always be interpreted with these limitations in mind. </p> <p> The strengths of VAERS are that it is national in scope"
"and can quickly provide an early warning of a safety problem with a vaccine. As part of CDC and FDA's multi-system approach to"
"post-licensure vaccine safety monitoring, VAERS is designed to rapidly detect unusual or unexpected patterns of adverse events,"
"also known as ""safety signals."" If a safety signal is found in VAERS, further studies can be done in safety systems such as"
"the CDC's Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) or the Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) project. These systems do not have"
"the same limitations as VAERS, and can better assess health risks and possible connections between adverse events and a vaccine."
"</p> <p> Key considerations and limitations of VAERS data: <ul><li> Vaccine providers are encouraged to report any clinically"
"significant health problem following vaccination to VAERS, whether or not they believe the vaccine was the cause. </li><li>"
"Reports may include incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental and unverified information. </li><li> The number of reports alone"
"cannot be interpreted or used to reach conclusions about the existence, severity, frequency, or rates of problems associated"
"with vaccines. </li><li> VAERS data are limited to vaccine adverse event reports received between 1990 and the most recent date"
"for which data are available. </li><li> VAERS data do not represent all known safety information for a vaccine and should be"
"interpreted in the context of other scientific information. </li></ul> </p>"
"2."
"3. Some items may have more than 1 occurrence in any single event report, such as Symptoms, Vaccine Products, Manufacturers, and"
"Event Categories. If data are grouped by any of these items, then the number in the Events Reported column may exceed the total"
"number of unique events. If percentages are shown, then the associated percentage of total unique event reports will exceed 100%"
"in such cases. For example, the number of Symptoms mentioned is likely to exceed the number of events reported, because many"
"reports include more than 1 Symptom. When more than 1 Symptom occurs in a single report, then the percentage of Symptoms to"
"unique events is more than 100%. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/vaers.html#Suppress."
"4. Data contains VAERS reports processed as of 09/10/2021. The VAERS data in WONDER are updated weekly, yet the VAERS system"
"receives continuous updates including revisions and new reports for preceding time periods. Duplicate event reports and/or"
"reports determined to be false are removed from VAERS. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/vaers.html#Reporting."
"5. Values of Event Category field vary in their availability over time due to changes in the reporting form. The ""Emergency"
"Room/Office Visit"" value was avaliable only for events reported using the VAERS-1 form, active 07/01/1990 to 06/29/2017. The"
"""Congenital Anomaly/Birth Defect"", ""Emergency Room"", and ""Office Visit"" values are available only for events reported"
"using the VAERS 2.0 form, active 06/30/2017 to present. These changes must be considered when evaluating count of events for"
"these categories."
"6. About COVID19 vaccines: <UL><LI> For more information on how many persons have been vaccinated in the US for COVID19 to date,"
"see https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations/: <a target= .. </LI><LI> One report may state that the patient"
"received more than one brand of COVID-19 vaccine on the same visit. This is a reporting error, but explains why the total number"
"of reports may not equal the total number of COVID-19 vaccine doses. </LI></UL>"
