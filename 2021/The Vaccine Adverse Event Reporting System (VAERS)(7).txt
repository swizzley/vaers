Additionally, left mid ovarian vein thrombus found. No thrombus in the renal veins or IVC. 4/28: Venous duplex demonstrated bilateral leg acute DVT. Eliquis was started. 5/7: Pt underwent laparoscopic biopsy/paracentesis. Eliquis was held 2 days prior to laparoscope...5/11: Pt presented to hospital with complaints of generalized weakness, fatigue and leg pain. CTPA showed bilateral PE. Pt received heparin drip and was switched back to Eliquis on discharge. Echocardiogram on 5/12 noted mobile round mass in RV junction, right atrial mass; presumed to be a thrombus. Pt additionally with elevated troponin, determined to likely demand ischemia related to PE; EKG without any acute changes. Discharged on 5/24. 5/27: Patient started on chemotherapy with gemcitabine/cisplatin for metastatic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.  6/4: Presented to the ED again due to worsening dyspnea and home pulse ox readings in the 70s. CT chest showed moderate burden of bilateral obstructive pulmonary emboli with no overt RV strain. EKOS and clot retrieval was contraindicated d/t thrombocytopenia. Was noted to have demand ischemia, and transitioned from eliquis to heparin gtt. Vascular was consulted for eval of her ischemic right foot, and deemed that it needed amputation, but would be a high risk surgery.  6/8: Patient was transferred to this reporting institution for second opinion requested by the family. Upon arrival, patient was found to be obtunded and hypotensive requiring heated high flow nasal cannula and vasopressor with norepinephrine. Code status was deemed DNRCCA/Do not intubate per family. Bedside ultrasound was concerning for an LV mass. Cardiology and Vascular surgery were consulted and recommended that the foot be amputated as well, but requested further workup with ECHO and CTA chest/abdomen/pelvis to further evaluate the LV mass. During admission workup, she was incidentally found to be COVID PCR positive. She was started on DEXA-ARDS prednisone dosing, remdesivir, and placed in enhanced droplet isolation.  Her hospital course was complicated by acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to pulmonary emboli, COVID-19 infection, and underlying malignancy requiring heated high flow nasal cannula. Empiric cefepime was started to treat any underlying superimposed pneumonia. Due to extensive clot burden with limb ischemia, as well as + COVID, she was systemically anticoagulated with a heparin drip despite her thrombocytopenia. She was intermittently given platelet transfusions in order to keep platelet count >30. TTE was obtained on 6/11 which showed large masses in right ventricle and right atrium, vegetations on mitral valve, aortic valve, and tricuspid valve, and probable mass in IVC. She also developed AKI with oliguria related to shock and critical illness. Medical oncology was consulted and she unfortunately was not a candidate for further chemotherapy at the time due to critical illness, as well as ischemic limb. (If further treatment was pursued, she would need a left leg amputation, then would require 4-6 weeks of recovery before additional chemotherapy could be given.) She slowly became more encephalopathic and had increased oxygen requirements, requiring continuous heated high flow nasal cannula. Goals of care were discussed with her family. Given her advanced cancer, it was decided to transition to comfort-focused care. Her code status was changed to DNRCC. Symptoms were controlled with IV pain and anxiety medication. She expired on 6/13/2021 at 0225."	"No PF4 collected, admission platelets 65, lowest platelets 21 Novel Coronavirus PCR- SARS-CoV-2 detected (6/9/2021)"	"No current illness for this event."

The morning after the second shot, my sister texted that her husband was up at least 10 times during the night, and five times the next night. He was agitated and hallucinating (swatting at bugs that weren't there.) For the next four weeks he had progressively more difficult breathing, and on 4/28 a liter of fluid was drained from his chest. He continued to have difficulty breathing and was taken by ambulance to Hospital on May 2 where they again drained his chest and diagnosed him with pneumonia. A nurse told him they were seeing a number of cases of fluid around the lungs (his fluid was around the lungs, not in them) after COVID vaccines. He was sent home May 4 and commented that it was strange his cardiologist hadn't visited.   Almost immediately he was experiencing liver and gall bladder pain, even though tests for those showed the two organs were healthy. On May 8 my sister said patient woke up hyperventilating, which also became more frequent. On the 9th his daughter told me the labs were not trending well, and on May 10 he saw his cardiologist. He diagnosed him with congestive heart failure and got him an appointment at the Heart Hospital on May 17 - he explained congestive heart failure is scary but can be managed through programs at the heart hospital. He began sleeping outside because it made it easier to breathe.   On May 15 he was advised to go to the ER/Hospital for tests the heart hospital would need and, once there, they discovered his kidneys weren't functioning and he was admitted immediately. He spent 17 days at Hospital- if the kidneys improved, the heart got worse. If the heart improved, the kidneys failed. He was released on June 2.   On June 7  my brother took him to get blood work done - Patient was too weak to get in and out of the car by himself. The blood work came back bad, and on June 8 he was admitted to the Heart Hospital. On June 10 he was transferred to the Regional Community Hospital to be closer to his cardiologist. From there he continued to decline, and the doctors wanted to do surgery for a LVAD but couldn't. To help him get stronger, he had an impeller put in by catheter on June 19 and died that night.   His own cardiologist said congestive heart failure is manageable. The symptoms started the night of the second vaccine and his illness wasn't gradual - he went off a cliff. With all the heart problems appearing in males, we don't think this was coincidence."	"You name it, they did it. You have the three hospitals and they probably have reams of test results.

He declined daily from a host of mysterious symptoms including full body rash, blood clots, muscle spasms, atrial fibrillation, ulcers lining his esophagus and colon, and exorbitant WBC (157K) with extremely high eosinophils (90%). He was treated with a host of drugs including antibiotics, steroids, blood thinners, ivermectin and finally chemotherpay (Campath).

After an incredible amount of diagnostic testing ( daily routine blood work, EKGs, chest x-rays, CT scans, MRI, bone marrow biopsy, endoscopy, colonoscopy, skin biopsy, genetic testing) no definitive diagnosis could be made, however, he was given the possible diagnosis of chronic eosinophilia leukemia in late May. The big question among the medical staff was, ""Did the shot trigger something?"" He was eventually treated with the chemotherapy drug Campath, which reduced the WBC and EOs some, but his organs, especially, lungs had been very compromised by the high WBC and eosinophils.

REASON FOR ADMISSION: Patient is a 13-year-old previously healthy male who was admitted after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with ROSC after CPR for 15 minutes in the field, found to be in the context of large cerebellar hemorrhage secondary to brain lesion (AVM vs tumor).   BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITALIZATION: Patient was intubated prior to arrival to the ED. Upon arrival he was started on epinephrine and norepinephrine drips to maintain perfusion and was administered bicarbonate x2. Head CTA was obtained and was notable for midbrain hemorrhage and tonsillar herniation, and no contrast enhanced blood flow in the brain.   Brain death exams were completed at 09:59 and 14:20. APNEA test was performed at 13:30, which is the official time of brain death.  Official cause of death was brainstem herniation from intracranial hemorrhage.    Mechanical ventilation was continued to allow family time to grieve and perform last rites. Time of cardiac death after mechanical ventilation withdrawal was 18:36.     HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:   FEN/Renal/Endo:  #Central DI He received 1.5 L of normal saline bolus in the ED and an additional 3 L of ringers lactate bolus overnight in the ICU to maintain perfusion and decrease heart rate.  His sodium was 141 upon presentation but reached a maximum of 160 due to central diabetes insipidus. He was started on 0.45% normal saline at 100 mL/hr to improve hypernatremia, which was monitored Q1h until normonatremic.  He additionally required vasopressin drip to be started due to central DI, which was increased to a maximum of 20 mU/kg/hr.    CV: At time of admission, epinephrine was running at 0.1 mcg/kg/min and norepinephrine was 0.1 mcg/kg/hr. Norepinephrine was increased shortly thereafter to 0.12 mcg/kg/min.   In the morning after admission, he had tachycardia to the 190s, which appeared to be narrow complex. Epinephrine and norepinephrine were discontinued. Two doses of adenosine were administered (6 mg first dose, 12 mg second dose) due to suspected SVT. The rate decreased for ~4 seconds after the second dose however returned to ~180. EKG arrived which showed sinus tachycardia so no further medications or cardiac interventions were done.  Fluid rates were increased to 2x MIVF rate and additional 500 mL bolus of LR was administered.   Norepinephrine and epinephrine were restarted and escalated due to low blood pressures in the early afternoon.to allow family time with patient.  Both titrated to effect.   Pulm: Patient was mechanically ventilated to achieve normal pH, normocarbia, and high arterial oxygen tension per brain death protocol.  He had no primary pulmonary disease during this admission.   Neuro:  #Intraparenchymal hemorrhage #Tonsillar herniation Neurosurgery was consulted. Mannitol x1 and hypertonic saline 23% x1 were administered to decrease intracranial pressures. Keppra 2g was administered for seizure prophylaxis. No sedation was needed during patient's hospitalization.

He was eating dinner on March 9 sitting at the bar with my Mom and for whatever reason when she got back to him (with 5minutes) he was on the floor balled up in a ball, all his muscles were tight- it was hard for us to get him to stretch or even move, unable to move or control his bowels. I went and got him and put him in bed, in the middle of the night he woke up and was going crazy. My Mom called the ambulance and they took him to the hospital and he stayed for 3 days. They got him some Occupation therapy and they were able to snap him out  a little bit. They helped him walk a little it was hard because he has only one arm. We ended up taking him to a nursing home for physical rehab for him to snap out of it but after 2 weeks in the home his brain and cognition and physical abilities deteriorated everyday. To the point we had to send him to a behavioral health hospital who tried to get him on medication to keep him from getting violent- he was there for 31 days and sent back to nursing home and lasted 3 weeks and then he passed away. It was just rapid exponential deteriorated from day to day and was unbelievable to watch.  Every Dr. that saw him said that the vaccine was a contributor to his rapid decline."

The patient was originally admitted on 5/22 for evaluation of bizarre behavior. She was noted to have flight of ideas, emotional instability and multiple attempts to leave the room naked. She was admitted to the floor there with behavioral health consulted for evaluation. She was then transferred to another  unit on 5/27/21 for additional management, with a plan for a 90 day inpatient hold.  While in the unit she was managed with a medication regimen including Thorazine, Lithium and Abilify.  Medicine was consulted for management of hypertension, and Ob-Gyn was following for abnormal vaginal bleeding with work-up unable to be completed due to her mental status.  ECT treatments were also started this week on 6/23, with the patient receiving her second ECT treatment this afternoon.  From review of the pre-procedure note, the planned induction was with etomidate, succinylcholine, glycopyrrolate, and Brevitol (methohexital, barbiturate class); the actual MAR is not up to date with her procedural medications at the time of admission.  Post treatment, the patient was noted to be conversive and in her normal state of health.  This evening, nursing staff heard a loud noise from the patient's room around 1630. Upon arrival, they found her down, unresponsive and without a pulse. An ACT was called  and CPR was initiated for a duration of approximately 30 minutes. Reportedly the AED display showed asystole, followed by PEA.  She received a reported five rounds of epinephrine, one dose of bicarbonate, and one dose of calcium during the event.  The patient was intubated during the code with a large amount of gastric contents present, concerning for aspiration.  A right ankle IO was placed due to significant difficulty securing access elsewhere.  ROSC was obtained with a junctional rhythm, and the patient was transferred for further management.      On arrival the patient is non-responsive without any sedation running.  She became hypotensive by arrival to the ICU requiring norepinephrine.  On later inspection of her IO, there was suspicion for infiltration of fluids and medications around her right ankle.  She has had significant secretions into her ETT since transfer.   HPI as noted above.  ICU course notable for hypoxic respiratory failure with ARDS likely from lung injury from cardiac arrest.  She subsequently developed shock and required vasopressors.  Initially the patient was noted to have brainstem reflexes, however on 6/25 the patient had an exam change with no spontaneous breaths and pupils fixed and dilated.  The initial head CT following arrest was performed which showed diffuse cerebral edema with effacement of the sulci and gray and white matter differentiation consistent with severe anoxic brain injury. There was diminished ventricular size with complete effacement of the fourth ventricle and tonsillar herniation from mass effect.  Neurology was consulted.     The patient remained on vasopressor and mechanical ventilator support. A NM scan was performed to evaluate cerebral blood flow showed absence of effective cerebral perfusion.  Neurology performed an exam and the patient was pronounced deceased at 1802 on 6/27/21 a doctor.   The family was informed of the results. After discussion with family, the patient was removed from mechanical ventilator support and vasoactive medications discontinued with the family at beside."	"ECT the morning of arrest."

The day after the vaccine was administered, her lower arm was swollen, red and her elbow felt hot to the touch.  It was too painful to fully extend her arm.  There was a white streak across the reddish purple elbow area where it appeared as though there was an infection growing.  She went  to her normal doctors office, she saw his nurse practitioner who took an x-ray and gave her two intravenous injections of antibiotic (unknown type).  One in each buttock and prescribed an oral antibiotic: Cephalexin 500 mg., and Ibuprofen 800 mg. From that day forward she was unable to move the arm at all and the medication did not bring the swelling or the infection down.  She was very tired and her arm did not lessen in pain as the days passed.    On June 29, 2021 she was in her bedroom and her older daughter was in her room and believed her mother was resting.  At approximately 7:20 p.m., pts. husband returned from work and came into the master bedroom turning on the television.  As he did so he made joke expecting pt. to laugh or comment, when she made no response he looked over at her and saw that she was laying on the love seat at an awkward angle.  He moved to her side and saw her eyes were open but unseeing and saw that her dental prosthetic was partially pushed out of place.  He removed and called EMS immediately, not detecting any obvious signs of life.  Her daughter came into the room and immediately started CPR.  Paramedics arrived in under 2 minutes and moved pt. to the living room where they could intubate a breathing pathway and carried on with attempts to revive her heart muscle for approximately 25 minutes before Paramedic called time of death at 8:02 p.m.   Paramedics departed and the Police arrived staying  until the Mortuary attendants came to the home at about midnight to accept pt. body for transport to its facility.      The Family is seeking an autopsy and the coroner is claiming one is not necessary.  The family believes it is absolutely necessary to ascertain whether or not the second dose caused her death as it seems is likely and whether she should have been advised of her heighten risk level. Regardless of COVID 19 Emergency measures, an autopsy is necessary and the family is determined to ensure that it is conducted.   Pt. has had a history of the following: Adult onset Asthma, allergic reactions in skin rashes that were significant. Hypothrodism (Graves Disease) which proved to be difficult to find the right meds to bring it under control; prone to incidents of Atrial fibrillation which have escalated as she has aged; she has been treated for emergency visits for Tachycardia; she frequently has developed respiratory issues as a result of the asthma which often landed her  in  the emergency and days in the hospital on oxygen.  She often experienced shortness of breath and chest pain and last year underwent emergency appendicitis.  Her last episode of atrial fibrillation which landed in the hospital was 12/29/16.  She has been on anticoagulants for many years.    Since COVID 19 she may not have been able to afford her Eliquis prescription however which she did not disclose to any of her family members that she was struggling in this wasy.   She is likely not to have been taking her Hypothyrodism (Graves) medication either since these medications have not been recovered since her death."	"No lab data for this event."

A 64-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EW0180), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 11Jun2021 10:00 (64-year-old at time of vaccination) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient's medical history included diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic/chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity. There was no family medical history relevant to adverse event. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EW0186), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 21May2021 (64-year-old at time of vaccination) for COVID-19 immunization. There were no vaccines administered on same date with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. There were no other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. The patient experienced chest pain on 17Jun2021, fluid and shortness of breath on 25Jun2021, and myocardial infarction on an unspecified date. Patient's wife (a registered nurse, recently retired) just wanted to report this. She can't say that it is the vaccine or anything. Her husband received the second COVID-19 Vaccine on 11Jun2021 and he died at the emergency room 2 weeks later of a cardiac event. She couldn't do the report online because it was making her the one she was reporting on. Chest pain: She took him to the emergency room on 25Jun2021. He had been having chest pain that he reported to her that Monday before. He told her that it actually started the Thursday before on 17Jun2021. He had some chest pain that felt a little better over the weekend, then Monday it was worse. He wasn't a complainer, but he was obviously having chest pain. He was very stubborn and so he just kind of let it progress and it got worse during the week. He wouldn't go to the doctor. She kept telling him she read about myocarditis mostly with adolescent males. She thought what if it is something like that. Time of Onset of Chest pain: He reported it on Monday that he had chest pain on Thursday. She became aware when he woke up at 06:30 on 21Jun2021 and she knew something was wrong when he went for the Ibuprofen. Fluid and shortness of breath: The day she took him to the emergency room the chest pain had worsened and he had fluid and shortness of breath. The fluid and shortness of breath started on 25Jun2021. Death: He died on 25Jun2021. The cause of death was a myocardial infarction. They didn't do an autopsy. The reason they gave for not being able to do an autopsy was they were overwhelmed with drug overdoses and homicides. Indication for COVID-19 Vaccine: He didn't want it, but he needed to go back to the office and didn't want to wear a mask. Adverse events required a visit to emergency room. Investigations: She doesn't have his medical records yet. Essentially they were recording him. She can't believe she got him in in a wheelchair. Immediately they were doing resuscitation efforts. Relevant Tests was reported as none. The outcome of myocardial infarction was fatal; outcome of other events was unknown. The patient died on 25Jun2021.  No autopsy was performed. The cause of death was a myocardial infarction. Causality: the reporting nurse has no opinion. She just thinks that the patient didn't randomly die any of his other 64 years. It may be a coincidence.; Sender's Comments: The event myocardial infarction with fatal outcome is considered unrelated to suspect product (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EW0180).

Footnotes:
"1. Submitting a report to VAERS does not mean that healthcare personnel or the vaccine caused or contributed to the adverse"
"event (possible side effect)."
"---"
Caveats:
"1. <p> VAERS accepts reports of adverse events and reactions that occur following vaccination. Healthcare providers, vaccine"
"manufacturers, and the public can submit reports to VAERS. While very important in monitoring vaccine safety, VAERS reports"
"alone cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness. The reports may contain"
"information that is incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental, or unverifiable. Most reports to VAERS are voluntary, which means they"
"are subject to biases. This creates specific limitations on how the data can be used scientifically. Data from VAERS reports"
"should always be interpreted with these limitations in mind. </p> <p> The strengths of VAERS are that it is national in scope"
"and can quickly provide an early warning of a safety problem with a vaccine. As part of CDC and FDA's multi-system approach to"
"post-licensure vaccine safety monitoring, VAERS is designed to rapidly detect unusual or unexpected patterns of adverse events,"
"also known as ""safety signals."" If a safety signal is found in VAERS, further studies can be done in safety systems such as"
"the CDC's Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) or the Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) project. These systems do not have"
"the same limitations as VAERS, and can better assess health risks and possible connections between adverse events and a vaccine."
"</p> <p> Key considerations and limitations of VAERS data: <ul><li> Vaccine providers are encouraged to report any clinically"
"significant health problem following vaccination to VAERS, whether or not they believe the vaccine was the cause. </li><li>"
"Reports may include incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental and unverified information. </li><li> The number of reports alone"
"cannot be interpreted or used to reach conclusions about the existence, severity, frequency, or rates of problems associated"
"with vaccines. </li><li> VAERS data are limited to vaccine adverse event reports received between 1990 and the most recent date"
"for which data are available. </li><li> VAERS data do not represent all known safety information for a vaccine and should be"
"interpreted in the context of other scientific information. </li></ul> </p>"
"2."
"3. Some items may have more than 1 occurrence in any single event report, such as Symptoms, Vaccine Products, Manufacturers, and"
"Event Categories. If data are grouped by any of these items, then the number in the Events Reported column may exceed the total"
"number of unique events. If percentages are shown, then the associated percentage of total unique event reports will exceed 100%"
"in such cases. For example, the number of Symptoms mentioned is likely to exceed the number of events reported, because many"
"reports include more than 1 Symptom. When more than 1 Symptom occurs in a single report, then the percentage of Symptoms to"
"unique events is more than 100%. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/vaers.html#Suppress."
"4. Data contains VAERS reports processed as of 09/10/2021. The VAERS data in WONDER are updated weekly, yet the VAERS system"
"receives continuous updates including revisions and new reports for preceding time periods. Duplicate event reports and/or"
"reports determined to be false are removed from VAERS. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/vaers.html#Reporting."
"5. Values of Event Category field vary in their availability over time due to changes in the reporting form. The ""Emergency"
"Room/Office Visit"" value was avaliable only for events reported using the VAERS-1 form, active 07/01/1990 to 06/29/2017. The"
"""Congenital Anomaly/Birth Defect"", ""Emergency Room"", and ""Office Visit"" values are available only for events reported"
"using the VAERS 2.0 form, active 06/30/2017 to present. These changes must be considered when evaluating count of events for"
"these categories."

"see https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations/: <a target= .. </LI><LI> One report may state that the patient"
"received more than one brand of COVID-19 vaccine on the same visit. This is a reporting error, but explains why the total number"
"of reports may not equal the total number of COVID-19 vaccine doses. </LI></UL>"
