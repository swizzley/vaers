Approximately 45 minutes later I received another call from the patient's roommate that EMS did not believe this was a reaction from the vaccine. The roommate mentioned that she was in fact mistaken about the blood pressure and it was actually low (92/54 mmHg). She also mentioned that the patient was vomiting.

Her oral temperature was 101.3.   About 1:30 PM, she was in her room and called out for her mother. When family went into the room, she was shaking ?like she was having a seizure? and then her eyes rolled back and she fell to her side and stopped breathing. Family called 911 and started CPR. CPR was continued by EMT?s once they arrived, but they were not able to resuscitate her."

He had poor oxygen saturation which prompted a visit to the ER. Upon x-ray he was found to have a large pneumonia in his left lung. After 10 days at the local hospital,  and being placed on a ventilator, he became septic and was air lifted to one of our area's larger hospitals. There, he was diagnosed with necrotizing pneumonia caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa. He also had heart rate accelerations that would climb into the 150s and they could never figure out why. He was treated aggressively with antibiotics and was successfully weaned off the vent. However, his body was unable to fight off the infection and he ended up passing away from necrotizing pneumonia that caused his respiratory system to fail. My father had underlying COPD that was well-managed at home and he did not require oxygen. I was questioned several times as to whether he'd gotten into or been around anyone or anything different from his usual, but he had not.

On 17-May-2021, the patient experienced SEIZURE (Seizures) (seriousness criteria hospitalization prolonged and medically significant) and THROMBOSIS (Bood clots) (seriousness criteria hospitalization prolonged and medically significant). The patient was hospitalized from 15-May-2021 to 25-May-2021 due to DYSPNOEA, GAIT DISTURBANCE, SEIZURE and THROMBOSIS. The patient died on 25-May-2021. The reported cause of death was Cardiac arrest, Acute hypoxic respiratory failure, ards and acute exacerbation of heart failure and sepsis. It is unknown if an autopsy was performed. At the time of death, SEIZURE (Seizures), THROMBOSIS (Bood clots), DYSPNOEA (Stuggling to breathe), GAIT DISTURBANCE (Struggling to walk), INFECTION (Blood infection) and PYREXIA (Fever) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 15-May-2021, Blood pressure measurement: elevated (High) Twice normal. On 15-May-2021, Glycosylated haemoglobin: elevated (High) High. On 15-May-2021, Oxygen saturation: low (Low) Required intubation and was placed on ventilator.. On 15-May-2021, SARS-CoV-2 antibody test: negative (Negative) 1 negative COVID antibody test. On 15-May-2021, SARS-CoV-2 test: negatie (Negative) 3 negative COVID antigen tests.         No concomitant medications were provided.  It was reported that within few hours after second dose of vaccine patient was struggling to walk and to breathe. The reporter and her husband went to see the patient and took him to an emergency room (ER). In the ER his blood pressure was markedly elevated (twice normal) and his oxygen level was low and by midnight he required intubation and was placed on a ventilator. His HbgA1c was noted to be elevated. Two days after admission (17-May-2021), he developed seizures which the medical team believed to be due to blood clots and he was anti-coagulated. It was determined that he did not have blood clots on his heart valves as the source of the clots. The source of the blood clots was never identified. He later developed fever and was diagnosed with a blood infection and treated with antibiotics. At one point his oxygen requirement on the ventilator went down to 65% but later returned and remained at 100%. He ultimately died on 25-May-2021 and as per copy of his death certificate he had 4 causes of death as cardiac arrest, acute hypoxic respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute exacerbation of heart failure and sepsis.

She got her vaccine and called her daughter in the afternoon around 2:00 and told her that she got it.  At 6:00 she received a VM where she said that she was having joint pain and wanted to know if she could call her doctor to get her joint pain medicine.  Later that evening her daughter told her that was why she was put on the Hydroxychloroquine and they wanted her to see the rheumatologist.  She complained of pain a lot, but she specifically asked for joint pain medicine.  On the 22nd on another VM her daughter noticed that she sounded raspy hoarse sounding and congested and had a cough.  Then subsequent messages after that the hoarseness was there that didn't go away.  Her daughter took her to the dentist on 4/15/21 and she remembered that the caregiver told her that she did not want to go to the dentist as she did not feel good.  She did not like to get out of the apartment.  Then on 4/19/21 she was admitted to the hospital and that she had pneumonia.  They were going to discharge her home and she was going to pick her up on 4/22/21, and then they called her back and told her that she sounded junky and they were going to keep her another day.  She made arrangements to pick her up on Friday and then her oxygens dropped and would discharge her on Monday.    She normally gets oxygen 1 liter of oxygen only at night, and when she was admitted her oxygen levels were low and they put her on 6 liters when she was admitted.  Then she was weaned off oxygen completely, and her daughter informed them that she slept with oxygen and that's when they were talking about going home.  On Friday she dropped her oxygen level into the 60's  On Saturday 4/24/21 she was on 9 liters of oxygen and the doctor came in and said that she was on 14.  By Saturday night she was on the Critical care Unit, but her on Vancomycin and was on Vapotherm on high-flow oxygen and she had maxed out at 40 liters at 100% oxygen.   They talked to the daughter about putting her on ventilation and thought it was toxicity to Vancomycin and other things and couldn't figure it out and said that it was some sort of inflammation of her lungs.  They put her on high levels of steroids and was then taken off of high-flow oxygen and then was still on 20% liters.  They recommended hospice and palliative care.  They decided to bring her home on Hospice with 15 liters of oxygen.  It was up and down levels.  She was given steroids when she came home on Hospice and was given steroids.  She then started to decline and hospice nurse came and she was admitted to Hershey and they repeated her chest x-ray and COVID testing, and that her lungs were so scarred there was nothing that they could do for her.  They tested her for COVID multiple times, the CAT Scans came back that it was worsening and consistent with COVID but tested negative twice while was there.  She was then sent to Hospital and tested again and was negative, and she passed on 5/10/2021.    HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS: She was admitted to  on 4/19/21 discharged home on hospice on 5/6/21.

CPR performed over ED course intermittently (always PEA arrest) with ROSC achieved with administration of EPI, EPI drip started in addition to sedation meds, and iv fluids. No obvious STEMI on ECG to administer lytics, with suspicion of dissection and AAA prominent. I am able to stabilze and accompany patient to CT suite, where I recognize B/L massive PE immediately. I discuss with Dr. of Cardiology, who agrees with admininstration of alteplase. I disucss risks with mother who consents verbally. Patient without response to alteplase, and with continued pattern of PEA arrest following bradycardia. I discuss etiology of presentation with mother,and that patient is with very poor prognosis of survival, and likely poorer prognosis of neurological status, and patient is made comfort care, and fentanyl drip increased, patient is taken off of ventilation and drips.

A 65-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 05May2021 as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. The cancer doctor told her that she needed a Covid vaccine since she has cancer and a lowered immune system. Medical history included Metastatic rectal cancer from Jul2019 to 17May2021, Osteoporosis from unknown date to 17May2021 (She had it for maybe 10 years or something), Fibromyalgia from unknown date to 17May2021 (She had the fibromyalgia for 20 years). She had rectal cancer, osteoporosis, fibromyalgia, and a couple other things that the caller can't think of off hand. Her mother was diagnosed with the rectal cancer in Jul2019. The caller has no idea when she was diagnosed with the osteoporosis. She had the fibromyalgia for 20 years, and the caller is sure it was the same for the osteoporosis, maybe 10 years or something. They were being managed. There were no concomitant medications.  The patient did have metastatic rectal cancer, but it was managed. She was not on hospice or terminal, and they hadn't exhausted all of the treatment plans yet. It was being controlled. She was under the surveillance of a cancer doctor who was completely shocked by her sudden death. It seemed like there was no reason. She was fine and drove herself to her appointments all the time. She had just driven herself to her last appointment. She passed away yesterday morning. She was slowly declining since she got the vaccine. The coroner was playing guessing games and assumed it was pancreatic cancer. Well, she didn't have pancreatic cancer, and the doctor already said the cancer didn't kill her. The doctor said if he had to guess it could have been some kind of pneumonia or a reaction to the vaccine. All of it made her heart stop. The coroner couldn't get the city to approve an autopsy to see the real cause of death because there was no foul play. The caller took it upon herself to discover if maybe Pfizer could help, and she needs to alleviate the vaccine as an option if it contributed. She is so tired and hasn't slept. It is devastating. This woman was everything in her life, and the caller is probably going to go next with how she feels. She feels responsible. Her other guess is if she gave her mother Covid and she slowly declined with pneumonia. The caller couldn't get her sister to take her mother to the ER. Her sister was there Sunday night. On Monday morning her sister called to say her mother was gone. On 05May2021 the patient had the first dose of the Covid vaccine. The caller could have gone there or called an ambulance when her mother wasn't answering the phone. She knew something was wrong. She called her sister who said their mother wasn't feeling good. Her mother was woozy, dizzy, and sleeping all the time. On day 3, Sunday, the caller couldn't get her mother on the phone. She thought she had some level of peace because her sister was there and could keep her updated. Her mother often gets sickly, but she always answers the phone even if she is deathly sick. The caller thought enough is enough and she needed to be put on the phone on speaker with her mother. The caller's sister said her mother was sleeping. The doctor said to probably bring her mother to the ER. The caller told her sister who just didn't take her mother to the ER. The caller could have called an ambulance. She feels incompetent. They are assuming the cause of death was a heart attack. If her mother had gone to the ER on Sunday night they may have found out. Her mother became woozy last weekend because the caller was there on Thursday and her mother didn't look good. She had her chemo bag because she brings it home. It was her first new chemo treatment, and the caller had never seen her mother respond like this. It was strange. Any other time when she was getting chemo she felt great because there is so much stuff in there like steroids to prevent a reaction. It was surprising because she was only sick on chemo once and she had been on this one before. She was just off. Then she continued to decline from there. It started before the chemo. She got on chemo that Thursday before Mother's Day, she was on her first chemo treatment at that time. She was sick a couple of days before that. She had the chemo on 06May2021. She started feeling sickly the day she got the injection on 05May2021. When the caller was there she was thinking it was from the chemo. The caller calls her mother every day and she was sounding worse and worse. On Thursday 13May2021 her mother took herself to her chemo follow up appointment and was telling the doctor that she was woozy, dizzy, and not eating. The doctor gave her fluids, and he didn't give her chemo because she was not scheduled for it that day. It was just a follow up appointment. He sent her home. The caller talked to her mother on Thursday evening and she didn't sound good and told her she was woozy and dizzy. On Friday, Saturday, and Sunday she didn't answer the phone. The caller's mother is totally against vaccines, and she had been begged to get the pneumonia and flu vaccine and denied them. She had never responded well to them in her life. Even as a cancer patient they would say she needed it and she wouldn't. She did get the Covid vaccine even though she didn't want to. The caller thought her mother was trying to convince herself it was because of the vaccine because she is so against them, but now she doesn't know. The doctor said he didn't think it would have been Covid because she didn't have a fever. Her mother told her that she had been running a fever off and on, which is not unusual for her mother. The doctor didn't think it would have been Covid. Her mother started sleeping all the time mid week last week. She started not eating at the end of last week. The caller has no idea when her mother had a fever. She hadn't gotten to talk to her mother all weekend. At some point last week her mother had said in a conversation that she had a fever off and on. Then on Thursday when she went to the chemo doctor she had no fever it shows it was 97 something. Her oxygen was fine. Her blood pressure was a bit low, 105 over something, which is low for her. She didn't have a fever last Thursday. Prior Vaccinations within 4 weeks no other vaccinations. Blood work on 13May2021 with unknown result. The patient passed away on 17May2021 after receiving the first dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine. The caller expresses concern that her mother may have had Covid. No autopsy done.

Then on Sunday, Mother's day on 5/9/21 and they face timed and was supposed to meet him at 5:30.  At 12:45 he had finished eating, ate some enchilladas and said that he felt weird.  He said that he was going to be ok to meet him at 5:30.  At 4:37 PM she texted him to say that she was on her way to meet him.  She got at the meeting place at 5:30 and he was usually there before her, this is a normal weekend ritual to exchange his dog.  She waited 9 minutes and she tried to facetime him thinking he was in traffic, and he didn't answer.  She thought he was just not answering.  She then waited 9 more minutes and then called his phone and local Hospital answered the phone and asked who she was, and she answered the questions, and she told her to get to the hospital.  She went to the hospital and the doctor came in and told her that he had the car running and he went to the gas pump to get gas and he stepped out of the car and collapsed.  The person who saw him told the attended that he had collapsed and they called 9-1-1 and he was pronounced dead.  He worked in a warehouse and was doing well and about to be certified to be a forklift driving.  They said that they worked on him and that they could not get his heart started again.   They had to do an autopsy which is against her religion and she will not find out those results for 3-6 months.  She said that he was healthy and looking forward to get tested at work.  They told her that he had an enlarged heart and an enlarged spleen, and had never had any heart issues in the past.    He walked 20,000 steps a day in the warehouse.    He was living in a sober man's facility, he has been clean for 18 months.  He had an addiction to pain pills and Xanax.

After treating him it didn't clear up. It was later diagnosed as herpes of the eye and he became blind in one eye. Shortly afterwards I read an article from researchers who stated they had found fragments of the herpes virus in the vaccine. After the second vaccine he was fine one day and 2 days later started having seizures. He was hospitalized for the seizures. His personality totally changed. He no longer recognized my sister. He also became hostile which is not the person he was. He was released from the hospital and brought to a new facility. Then the lights went out. he just stared off into space.

At Hospital, she was treated with convalescent plasma, course of remdesivir, and dexamethasone. She was requiring HFNC during day and BiPap overnight. She began to improve with decreasing O2 requirements on 4/15. On 4/17, she was found to have L-sided deficits and increasing hypoxia, which required emergent intubation. Dexamethasone was increased to 6 mg BID and she was started on Levaquin and Flagyl for aspiration penumonia, consolidated to ertapenem on 4/20. She had been on Eliquis prior to this, but this was discontinued after she developed the stroke sx on 4/17, switched to Lovenox. Initial head CT negative, but repeat head CT on 4/19 showed large R sided MCA territory infarct. She was placed on ASA. 4/21 head CT showed edema and mild midline shift. Neurology was consulted, who recommended hyperventilation, 3% saline, and elevating HOB > 30 degrees. She was then transferred to St. Mary's ICU on 4/21. At  Hospital, patient was treated for aspiration pneumonia (cefepime 2g Q8H on 4/22-4/25, meropenem 2g once on 4/22, tobramycin 400mg daily on 4/22-4/23) and COVID.  However, she had significant difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation. Given her prolonged course and her right MCA CVA with significant deficits it was predicted that she would need long term ventilatory support therefore PEG and tracheostomy were placed on 4/29. She remained relatively stable until 5/2 AM when she suddenly developed massive subcutaneous emphysema and hypoxia. It was suspected that her tracheostomy had become dislodged. Patient was re-intubated orally with difficulty however there was no color change with EtCO2 and patient was in cardiac arrest. CPR was briefly performed however code status was clarified and patient was DNR. Trauma surgeon and intensivist were in agreement that any other interventions would be futile.

He seemed to be getting worse and was put on a more potent inhaler with cortisone and took an OTC supplement called NAC which he bought at a healthfood store.  Then on May 19 at 7;45am we were sitting on the sofa having morning  coffee.  I noticed he was  having what looked like a  worse breathing episode. I asked if I should call 911.  He said, ""No, this will pass."" So I said I was going to take a Pulse/Oximeter reading because I brought that and an AED from our surgery center which we had just closed and retired in 2019.  His O2 was 100% w 62 pulse.  That looked good to me. I layed down the Pulse/Oximeter and  about a minute or two he had a cardia arrest! I called 911, pulled him on the floor and started CPR while talking with the EMS all the while. I stopped for a minute to put on the AED.  I told EMS I am going to defibrillate , he has not pulse!  The AED did not go off.  I continued CPR, then the EMS came and started CPR and tried defibrillation but theirs did not go off. The EMS told me he was in a PEA (pulseless electrical activity) where he had not heartbeat but still had electrical activity in his body so the the debribrillators  read it as a rythymn that was not amenable to defibrillation..

Footnotes:
"1. Submitting a report to VAERS does not mean that healthcare personnel or the vaccine caused or contributed to the adverse"
"event (possible side effect)."
"---"
Caveats:
"1. <p> VAERS accepts reports of adverse events and reactions that occur following vaccination. Healthcare providers, vaccine"
"manufacturers, and the public can submit reports to VAERS. While very important in monitoring vaccine safety, VAERS reports"
"alone cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness. The reports may contain"
"information that is incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental, or unverifiable. Most reports to VAERS are voluntary, which means they"
"are subject to biases. This creates specific limitations on how the data can be used scientifically. Data from VAERS reports"
"should always be interpreted with these limitations in mind. </p> <p> The strengths of VAERS are that it is national in scope"
"and can quickly provide an early warning of a safety problem with a vaccine. As part of CDC and FDA's multi-system approach to"
"post-licensure vaccine safety monitoring, VAERS is designed to rapidly detect unusual or unexpected patterns of adverse events,"
"also known as ""safety signals."" If a safety signal is found in VAERS, further studies can be done in safety systems such as"
"the CDC's Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) or the Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) project. These systems do not have"
"the same limitations as VAERS, and can better assess health risks and possible connections between adverse events and a vaccine."
"</p> <p> Key considerations and limitations of VAERS data: <ul><li> Vaccine providers are encouraged to report any clinically"
"significant health problem following vaccination to VAERS, whether or not they believe the vaccine was the cause. </li><li>"
"Reports may include incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental and unverified information. </li><li> The number of reports alone"
"cannot be interpreted or used to reach conclusions about the existence, severity, frequency, or rates of problems associated"
"with vaccines. </li><li> VAERS data are limited to vaccine adverse event reports received between 1990 and the most recent date"
"for which data are available. </li><li> VAERS data do not represent all known safety information for a vaccine and should be"
"interpreted in the context of other scientific information. </li></ul> </p>"
"2."
"3. Some items may have more than 1 occurrence in any single event report, such as Symptoms, Vaccine Products, Manufacturers, and"
"Event Categories. If data are grouped by any of these items, then the number in the Events Reported column may exceed the total"
"number of unique events. If percentages are shown, then the associated percentage of total unique event reports will exceed 100%"
"in such cases. For example, the number of Symptoms mentioned is likely to exceed the number of events reported, because many"
"reports include more than 1 Symptom. When more than 1 Symptom occurs in a single report, then the percentage of Symptoms to"
"unique events is more than 100%. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/vaers.html#Suppress."
"4. Data contains VAERS reports processed as of 09/10/2021. The VAERS data in WONDER are updated weekly, yet the VAERS system"
"receives continuous updates including revisions and new reports for preceding time periods. Duplicate event reports and/or"
"reports determined to be false are removed from VAERS. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/vaers.html#Reporting."
"5. Values of Event Category field vary in their availability over time due to changes in the reporting form. The ""Emergency"
"Room/Office Visit"" value was avaliable only for events reported using the VAERS-1 form, active 07/01/1990 to 06/29/2017. The"
"""Congenital Anomaly/Birth Defect"", ""Emergency Room"", and ""Office Visit"" values are available only for events reported"
"using the VAERS 2.0 form, active 06/30/2017 to present. These changes must be considered when evaluating count of events for"
"these categories."
"6. About COVID19 vaccines: <UL><LI> For more information on how many persons have been vaccinated in the US for COVID19 to date,"
"see https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations/: <a target= .. </LI><LI> One report may state that the patient"
"received more than one brand of COVID-19 vaccine on the same visit. This is a reporting error, but explains why the total number"
"of reports may not equal the total number of COVID-19 vaccine doses. </LI></UL>"
